# Technical Charter for the Open Source Security Foundation

Alpha-Omega

Adopted February 1, 2022

This Technical Charter sets forth the responsibilities and procedures for technical contribution to, and oversight of, the Alpha-Omega project, which has been established as a Special Interest Fund (the "Special Interest Fund" or "SIF" under the Open Source Security Foundation (the "OpenSSF").  All contributors (including committers, maintainers, and other technical positions) and other participants in the Technical Initiative (collectively, "Collaborators") must comply with the terms of this Technical Charter and the OpenSSF Charter. 

#### 1. Mission and Scope of the Technical Initiative

a. The mission ("Mission") of the Technical Initiative is to protect society by improving the security of open source software through direct maintainer engagement and expert analysis. Our vision is one where critical open source projects are secure, and that vulnerabilities are found and fixed quickly.

b. The scope of the Technical Initiative includes two parts, "Alpha" and "Omega". Through Alpha, we seek to improve the security of the most critical open source projects by providing funding and/or working directly with the project maintainers or their parent organizations or foundations. Through Omega, we seek to identify and fix critical security vulnerabilities in roughly the top 10,000 most-important open source projects, by running security tools, triaging results, and connecting with maintainers. Through Omega, we may also build technology to identify and/or mitigate security risk at scale.

c. As a SIF, the Technical Initiative is funded directly by organizations (a "Funding Organization"). A minimum funding amount is required to hold a position on the Technical Steering Committee ("TSC"). This minimum is currently $2.5 million per year and may change based on a decision by the TSC.

d. The Technical Initiative may accept undirected funds from organizations in furtherence of the Mission; the contributing organization will not have a position on the Technical Steering Committee and will not have a direct role in the Technical Initiative's governance.

e. The Technical Initiative will periodically inform the OpenSSF Technical Advisory Committee of planned funding and progress toward our goals.

f. The Technical Initiative will avoid funding any open source project that is governed by an organization that provides funding directly to Alpha-Omega.

g. The Technical Initiative will hold monthly public meetings, scheduled via the OpenSSF public calendar.


#### 2. Technical Steering Committee

a. All decisions relevant to the operations of the Technical Initiative, including budget decisions, are made by the Technical Steering Committee, which is comprised of one member from each Funding Organization, plus one member appointed by the Linux Foundation.

b. Funding Organizations may choose to abstain from designating a Technical Steering Committee representative and may change their decision at any time.

c. The Technical Initiative may involve Collaborators and Contributors. The TSC may adopt or modify additional roles so long as the roles are documented in the Technical Initiative’s repository. Unless otherwise documented: 

- i. Contributors include anyone in the technical community that contributes effort, ideas, code, documentation, or other artifacts to the Technical Initiative; 

- ii. Collaborators are Contributors who have earned the ability to modify ("commit") text, source code, documentation or other artifacts in the Technical Initiative’s repository or direct the agenda or working activities of the Technical Initiative; and

- iii. A Contributor may become a Collaborator through a decision of the TSC. A Collaborator may be removed by through a decision of the TSC.

- iv. Maintainers are the initial Collaborators defined at the creation of the Technical Initiative. The Maintainers will determine the process for selecting future Maintainers. A Maintainer may be removed by two-thirds approval of the other existing Maintainers, or a majority of the other existing Collaborators.

d. Participation in the Technical Initiative through becoming a Contributor, Collaborator, or Maintainer is open to anyone, whether a OpenSSF member or not, so long as they abide by the terms of this Technical Charter. However,
the specifics of what "Participation" means is defined by the TSC. For example, contributing to the content in the Technical Initiative's GitHub repository is open to all; making decisions about funding or project strategy is limited to TSC members.

e. The TSC may create, change, modify, or remove roles or their definitions, so long as the definitions of roles for the Technical Initiative are publicly available in the Technical Initiative repository.

f. The TSC may elect a TSC Chair, who will preside over meetings of the TSC and will serve until their resignation or replacement by the TSC.  **The TSC Chair, or any other TSC member so designated by the TSC, will serve as the Technical Initiative’s voting representative on the OpenSSF’s Technical Advisory Council (the "TAC").
