# Alpha-Omega

Welcome!

Through Alpha-Omega, we aim to meaningfully improve the security of the open source software
projects that we all depend so deeply upon.

**Alpha** will work with the maintainers of the most critical open source projects to help them
identify and fix security vulnerabilities, and improve their security posture.

**Omega** will identify at least 10,000 widely deployed OSS projects where it can apply automated
security analysis, scoring, and remediation guidance to their open source maintainer communities.

To learn more, view the [Alpha-Omega home page](https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/) or
watch our kickoff webinar video below:
