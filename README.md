# Alpha-Omega

Alpha-Omega's mission is to catalyze sustainable security improvements to critical open source projects and ecosystems. 
We accomplish this in various ways, such as funding security staff at organizations like the Rust Foundation and the
Eclipse Foundation, security improvements to projects like Homebrew, security audits of projects like OpenSSL, and
security features in projects like Rustls. We also sponsor work to identify serious vulnerabilities across a large
set of open source projects, such as our work through OpenRefactory. 

Since 2022, Alpha-Omega has been working hard, "turning money into security". Learn more at [alpha-omega.dev](https://alpha-omega.dev)
