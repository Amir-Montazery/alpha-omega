# Build provenance for Homebrew: October 2023

## Completed

* Designed, implemented, and released
  [`sigstore-rekor-types`](https://pypi.org/project/sigstore-rekor-types/)
  to give `sigstore-python` access to DSSE models (in preparation for
  DSSE support for the Homebrew build and publish attestations).

* Integrated `sigstore-rekor-types` into `sigstore-python`:
  [sigstore-python#788](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/788)

* Created
  [`trailofbits/homebrew-attestation`](https://github.com/trailofbits/homebrew-attestation)
  as an initial design for the Homebrew attestation formats, with plans
  to donate the repository to Homebrew once the format is stabilized.

## In progress

* Opened [purl-spec#254](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/issues/254)
  to begin the standardization of a package URL format for Homebrew.

* Began work on DSSE signing and verification support in `sigstore-python`:
  [sigstore-python#804](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/issues/804)
