# Build provenance for Homebrew: January 2024

*Logistical note*: This update also contains updates from December.

## Completed

* We've merged initial attestation generation support into `homebrew-core`,
  meaning that all new bottle builds/uploads are being accompanied by
  build provenance: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/160941

* We've made changes to Homebrew's build workflows to enabled build
  provenance generation: https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/pull/160941

* We performed a earlier provenance generation test on `Homebrew/actions`:
  https://github.com/Homebrew/actions/pull/479

* We completed API-level DSSE signing support in `sigstore-python`:
  https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/804

* We have continued to perform refactoring and cleanup tasks on `sigstore-python`
  in support of DSSE signing and verification:
  https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/862

* We've submitted API improvements to `python-betterproto` in preparation
  for integrating `betterproto` into `in_toto_attestations`:
  https://github.com/danielgtaylor/python-betterproto/pull/551

* We've made code quality, CI/CD, and API improvements to `in_toto_attestations`:
  https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/issues/311,
  https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/pull/312,
  https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/pull/306,
  https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/pull/301

## In progress

* We are investigating the second stage of build provenance generation
  for `homebrew-core` ("backfill" attestations for pre-existing
  bottles)

* We are beginning work on a `brew` subcommand for build provenance generation:
  https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/issues/16543

* We are continuing work on support for `betterproto` in `in_toto_attestations`:
  https://github.com/in-toto/attestation/pull/315

* We are continuing refactor and standards work in support of DSSE verification in
  `sigstore-python`: https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/876,
  https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-conformance/issues/122
