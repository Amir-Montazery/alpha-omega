# Build provenance for Homebrew: April 2024

This monthly update concludes the bulk of the work scoped under
the [Build Provenance and Code Signing for Homebrew](https://repos.openssf.org/proposals/build-provenance-and-code-signing-for-homebrew)
project.

## Completed

* We completed our initial integration of attestation verification into
  Homebrew! As of release [4.2.18](https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/releases/tag/4.2.18),
  `brew install` will perform build provenance verification when the user
  sets `HOMEBREW_VERIFY_ATTESTATIONS`. Future versions of `brew` will elevate
  this behavior to on-by-default for people running Homebrew in development
  mode, followed by all users:
  <https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/17049>,
  <https://github.com/Homebrew/brew/pull/17190>.

* We completed an initial version of `brew verify` as an external command,
  including final implementation details built on top of the `Homebrew/brew`
  APIs merged above:
  <https://github.com/trailofbits/homebrew-brew-verify/pull/4>,
  <https://github.com/trailofbits/homebrew-brew-verify/pull/5>,
  <https://github.com/trailofbits/homebrew-brew-verify/pull/6>,
  <https://github.com/trailofbits/homebrew-brew-verify/pull/7>,
  <https://github.com/trailofbits/homebrew-brew-verify/pull/9>,
  <https://github.com/trailofbits/homebrew-brew-verify/pull/10>.

* We completed sigstore-python's initial DSSE feature set, including public APIs
  for both signing and verification and extensive simplifying refactors:
  <https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/937>,
  <https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/955>,
  <https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/959>,
  <https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/962>,
  <https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/972>.

* We delivered our SOSS Day NA presentation on our implementation:
  <https://sched.co/1aNLt>.

## In progress

* We are coordinating a final readout and project summary/information sharing
  session with Michael Winser, to be presented to various stakeholders and
  interested parties on 2024-05-07.

* We are preparing publication materials related to this work, including
  coordinated blog posts/announcements between Trail of Bits, Alpha-Omega,
  and Homebrew.

* We are coordinating with both GitHub's Package Security team and performing
  ongoing feature support on `Homebrew/brew`, as part of monitoring the stability
  and usability of all merged work.
