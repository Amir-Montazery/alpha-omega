# Build provenance for Homebrew: November 2023

*Logistical note*: Trail of Bits conducted fewer hours of engineering
this month, due to employee time off and company holidays.

## Completed

* Coordinated with GitHub's engineers and the Homebrew maintainers to enable
  early access to GitHub's new provenance functionality on both
  `homebrew/homebrew-core` and `trail-of-forks/homebrew-core`.

* Wrote and coordinated announcement blog posts for Homebrew's build provenance:
  [Trail of Bits](https://blog.trailofbits.com/2023/11/06/adding-build-provenance-to-homebrew/),
  [Alpha-Omega](https://alpha-omega.dev/blog/alpha-omega-grant-to-help-homebrew-reach-slsa-build-level-2/).

## In progress

* Began work on an initial integration between `homebrew-core`'s bottle building
  workflows (`dispatch-build-bottle.yml`) and GitHub's provenance generation.

* Continued work on a package URL (purl) specification for Homebrew packages.

* Continued work on DSSE signing and verification support in `sigstore-python`.
