# Build provenance for Homebrew: March 2024

## Completed

* We completed our initial "backfill" attestation round for `homebrew-core`,
  meaning that all bottles served by `homebrew-core` now either have a
  direct build provenance from Homebrew's own CI or have a "backfill"
  attestation signed by `trailofbits/homebrew-brew-verify` with workflow
  identity `.github/workflows/backfill_signatures.yml@refs/heads/main`.

  The full set of backfilled attestations can be viewed here:
  <https://github.com/trailofbits/homebrew-brew-verify/attestations>.

* We completed an initial round of verification API refactoring in
  `sigstore-python`, in preparation for DSSE signature verification support:
  <https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/904>,
  <https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/930>,
  <https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/935>,
  <https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/945>.

* We performed a 2.1.3 release of `sigstore-python`, including a
  fix for the `sigstore-protobuf-specs` subdependency:
  <https://pypi.org/project/sigstore/2.1.3/>.

## In progress

* We are continuing our work on a `brew verify` subcommand for provenance
  verification, including a fallback for "backfilled" attestations.

* We are continuing our refactoring and development work on `sigstore-python`'s
  verification APIs, in preparation for DSSE signature verification support:
  <https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/937>.

* We are preparing a [SOSS Community Day NA](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/soss-community-day-north-america/)
  presentation on the overall status of the work.
