February was the month during which we accepted resumes for the Security Developer in Residence Role, see our post here. https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/01/the-psf-is-hiring-security-developer-in.html
Since the posting, we received over 50 applications, have conducted screens with 10 and are likely promoting 4 candidates to a longer interview and exercise.
