# Update-2023-07

## Python Software Foundation as CVE Numbering Authority

- Received approval from the Python Steering Council and pip maintainers to scope Python and pip under the prospective PSF CVE Numbering Authority (CNA).
- Submitted registration for CNA onboarding and received onboarding date (August 21st) and materials from MITRE.
- Discussed the creation of materials for CNA registration of open source projects with OSSF Vulnerability Disclosures WG. Aimed at creating "minimum-viable CNA" which can be run by volunteers.
- Authored a Vulnerability Disclosure policy and machine-readable advisory database using OSV.
- Documented CNA Rules, Onboarding, and Services (APIs) for other PSF CNA staff providing coverage.

## Sigstore signed Python release artifacts

- [Created a project](https://github.com/sethmlarson/verify-python-release-signatures/)
  which verifies Sigstore verification materials against Python release artifacts
  and the documentation of identities. Found [multiple issues](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/issues/600)
  with artifact signatures and mismatches with documentation.
- Worked with release managers to create a plan for resigning artifacts correctly and updating the documentation
  to match the signatures of a release manager. Ended up with a table of (identity x provider) pairs for each release
  manager. Documentation and signatures now match up and verify consistently.
- [Created an enhancement](https://github.com/python/release-tools/pull/51) to Python's release tools which will ensure
  Sigstore signatures will continue to be consistent with documentation.

Separately from fixing the Sigstore signatures of Python, I also was interested in unifying disjoint Sigstore verification materials (`.crt`/`.sig`)
and bundled Sigstore verification materials (`.sigstore`) in order to simplify the documentation on how to verify release artifacts.
This was also motivated by `sigstore-python` moving to generated only bundles by default.

- Migrating to bundles from existing disjoint materials currently isn't possible with `sigstore-python`,
  [created an issue](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/issues/718) with William Woodruff for this enhancement.
  This enhancement may be useful to [other implementations](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/issues/718#issuecomment-1654048226)
  to provide a migration path from disjoint matierals to bundles.
- [Created an enhancement](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/719) to `sigstore-python` for the internal API
  accomplishing this migration path. This will be enough to create a script to manually migrate disjoint materials to bundles
  for Python and will soon be available via CLI to others.

## SBOMs and PEP 710

- [Created a dataset](https://github.com/sethmlarson/vendored-libraries-in-python-dists) which tracks non-Python artifacts bundled with top Python packages
  in order to better understand how different packages bundled non-Python dependencies.
- Through this work discovered two vulnerabilities in Python packages due to bundling insecure versions of software that was accessible through the Python APIs.
- [Wrote about the findings](https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-2#bundled-libraries-in-python-distributions) from this initial discovery work and its applicability to manylinux and Python bundling tools.
- [Reviewed PEP 710](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-710-recording-the-provenance-of-installed-packages/25428/6?u=sethmlarson) (Package Provenance Info) and reached out to Fridolín Pokorný to
  collaborate on the PEP. This PEP has important applications in SBOMs by providing the hashes
  download URL, and index that a given package was installed from.
- In order to prove the application of PEP 710, [created an experimental tool](https://github.com/sethmlarson/pip-sbom) that transforms the
  information provided by the POC that Fridolín created for the PEP into CycloneDX and SPDX SBOM formats.
- Investigated [pip installation report format](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/installation-report/) which is similar
  but requires specifying the packages to install rather than inspecting an already-installed environment.
  Added preliminary support for pip installation reports to the experimental tool as well.
- Discussed with Dustin Ingram and Jeff Edwards who are authors of a [previous PEP draft](https://github.com/di/peps/blob/sboms/pep-9999.rst)
  on including SBOMs in Python wheels about collaborating on this work. Dustin agreed for me to lead another draft PEP
  going a different direction from the original draft. I am currently doing discovery work on this project.
