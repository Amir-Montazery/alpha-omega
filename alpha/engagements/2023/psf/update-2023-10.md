## Highlight: Security Developer-in-Residence 2023 Q3 Report

Wrote and published the report for Q3 in the Security Developer-in-Residence role.
Included all the highlighted accomplishments in the role like the PSF becoming a
CNA, advisories in an OSV database, improvements to the Python Security Response Team,
and more.

In this post I also detail the three areas that I want to focus on for the next quarter which are:

* Securing the CPython release process
* Metadata for bundled projects in Python packages
* SBOM for CPython release artifacts

## Highlight: CPython Release Process

I've made progress on improving the CPython release process. Starting with automating the process in GitHub Actions
and achieving a content-wise identical tarball to what was published for CPython v3.12.0. Using
tooling for reproducible builds like `diffoscope` and `reprotest` was able to remove all sources of
non-reproducibility from the CPython source builds and got the changes [merged into the CPython release process](https://github.com/python/release-tools/pull/62).
Verified that reproducibility had worked as expected for CPython 3.13.0a1.

Created [roadmap for future improvements to the CPython release process](https://github.com/python/release-tools/issues/66)
which include moving the source, docs, and macOS installer builds to an isolated platform (in this case, GitHub Actions).
From there being able to make at least the macOS installer and Windows installer builds reproducible would also be desirable.

The work was discussed on the [CPython core developer podcast "core.py"](https://podcasters.spotify.com/pod/show/corepy/episodes/Episode-1---Core-Sprint-in-Brno--Python-3-13-0-alpha-1-e2apebk)
by ≈Åukasz Langa and Pablo Galindo Salgado.

## Highlight: Patching the libwebp vulnerability across the Python ecosystem

I set out to patch the libwebp vulnerability across the ecosystem. Python
packages tend to bundle third-party shared libraries in wheels. I documented
all the problems I ran into through this process, including the need for
metadata around bundled projects in Python packages.

## Highlight: Tracking how Python subcomponents change using SBOMs

Even though the Python APIs haven't changed, there's been lots of movement below the surface.
I created Software Bill-of-Materials (SBOMs) to track the subcomponents of CPython and to see how
this changes between releases.

I created an [SBOM for Python 3.12.0](https://github.com/sethmlarson/cpython-sbom/blob/main/sboms/Python-3.12.0.tgz.spdx.json) and then compared the components against the ones included in Python 3.11.6.
Comparing the two SBOM documents revealed the differences between the two release streams, including:

* [Python 3.12 removes `setuptools`](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/101039) from the `ensurepip` module which was previously needed to bootstrap pip and venv in a Python environment.
  Now in 3.12.0 there's only a bundled copy of `pip` which includes many other bundled dependencies like Requests and certifi.
  These packages [still need to be captured in the CPython SBOM](https://github.com/sethmlarson/cpython-sbom/issues/10).
* [Python 3.12 replaces the implementation of hashlib algorithms using OpenSSL and tiny\_sha3](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/99108) with a [new backend called HACL\*](https://github.com/hacl-star/hacl-star) (pronounced "H-A-C-L star")
  which means the tiny_sha3 project can be removed. This new backend is formally verified using F\* to provide memory safety
  and avoid many common security vulnerabilities.
* [Python 3.12 removes the small libffi stub for OSX](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/100540) which was unused
  after [adding support for macOS 11 and Apple Silicon](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/72677).

[Read the full section in a blog post, which includes a visualization](https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-13#tracking-how-python-subcomponents-change-using-sboms).

Next steps for the SBOM work will be to add it to the CPython release process and to upstream in a way that is maintainable by core developers.
