## Highlight: CPython Release Process

- Spoke with CPython release manager and developer-in-residence **≈Åukasz Langa** about the CPython release process.
- Took extensive notes and [created a diagram and description](https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-9) that shows off the steps in one graphic along with the sources of supply chain risk.
- This diagram was covered pretty extensively (according to my website analytics, one of my top articles):
  - [Front page of HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37464950)
  - [PyCoders Weekly](https://pycoders.com/issues/595)
  - [Discussed on the Python Bytes podcast](https://pythonbytes.fm/episodes/show/354/python-3.12-is-coming)
  - [I was invited to speak about it on the TalkPython podcast about the article](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0fw2wKCS9B4)
- [Created POC for building the CPython source tarball release artifacts](https://github.com/sethmlarson/release-tools/commit/ac779416fb1d5b441821371b4027234ce2c7c016) using GitHub Actions and SLSA
- Spoke with macOS Release Manager **Ned Deily** about the macOS binary installer build process
  - Delaying this work for a month due to the process getting a revamp at the next CPython Core Developer sprint.
  - Provided some early context into what I'd like to see to make the process more secure and how it fits in with a larger supply chain security improvement project.

## Highlight: CPython vulnerabilities published to Open Source Vulnerability Database

- [Security advisories for Python](https://osv.dev/vulnerability/PSF-2023-8) are now published to the [OSV Vulnerability Database](https://osv.dev)! üéâü•≥ This means you can use
  [the OSV API](https://google.github.io/osv.dev/api/) to access machine-parseable information about security vulnerabilities affecting Python.
- Vulnerability information is ingested from the Python Software Foundation's [Advisory Database on GitHub](https://github.com/psf/advisory-database)
- Worked with **Oliver Chang** and **Andrew Pollock** to [set up the ingestion into the database and helping resolve issues](https://github.com/google/osv.dev/issues/1552).

## CPython Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)

- Started working on creating an authoritative SBOM for CPython release artifacts
  - https://github.com/sethmlarson/cpython-sbom
- The SBOMs I've created already can detect vulnerabilities in CPython and subcomponents of CPython like libffi, expat, etc.
- Got interest from a few SBOM contributors to improve the thoroughness of the fields.
- Goal is to meet the NTIA Minimum Elements and then integrate the SBOM generation into the continuous integration and release process of CPython.

## Becoming a CNA as an Open Source Organization or Project

- This is a guidance document for Open Source orgs / projects looking to become CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs)
- [Document is nearing the finish line](https://github.com/ossf/wg-vulnerability-disclosures/pull/139) for being published by the OpenSSF Vulnerability Disclosures WG
  - Reviewed by OSSF Vuln Disc WG, CVE Outreach and Community WG, and CVE Coordination WG.
  - Received lots of feedback which has been integrated.
  - Identified discrepancies and errata between CNA Rules and experience will be fed back into the CVE Program
    and next revision of rules.
- Invited to write an "Our CVE Story" piece to the CVE blog.

## Sigstore signatures for CPython releases

- All CPython releases that now have any Sigstore verification materials have
"bundles" (ie `.sigstore` files) instead of only "disjoint verification materials" (ie `.crt` and `.sig` files).
These new bundles [were back-filled from existing verification materials](https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/issues/2300)
- **≈Åukasz Langa** verified the new bundles and published them to python.org.
- I've updated the [Sigstore verification instructions on python.org](https://www.python.org/download/sigstore/)
to only reference bundles.
- This work got mentioned in the [upcoming blog post about Sigstore Python v2.0](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-blog/pull/45).

## Truststore and System Certificates

- Now that PyPy supports Python 3.10 I [added support for PyPy 3.10 to Truststore](https://github.com/sethmlarson/truststore/pull/113).
- Spoke with **Jannis Leidel** from Conda to confirm that I was happy with Conda moving forward with using Truststore as a dependency
and to provide some guidance.
- Conda has [merged the pull request](https://github.com/conda/conda/pull/13075) to add Truststore support to Conda which is slated for v23.9.0. This required creating a [top-level feedstock
for Truststore](https://github.com/AnacondaRecipes/truststore-feedstock/pull/2).
- pip has merged the pull request to bundle Truststore into pip, so it's no longer required to "bootstrap" Truststore in order to have support for using system certificates. This feature will be coming in pip v23.3.
- PDM (another Python package installer) released [v2.9.0](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/releases/tag/2.9.0) which uses Truststore by default on Python 3.10+.

## GitHub Security Advisories (GHSA) for Python Security Response Team (PSRT)

- Created GitHub App to add the PSRT GitHub team to new drafts/reports of GitHub Security Advisories.
- Found a feature gap in the GitHub webhook events for GHSAs, [made a feature request to GitHub](https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/67871).

## Handling of CVE-2023-5129 (known-exploited libwebp vulnerability)

* Reached out to projects that were affected by the vulnerable libwebp binary.
* Added advisories to the PyPI OSV Database for [Pillow](https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/commit/297597c0f217bb5b9213c074123166aa6398bff7) and [imagecodecs](https://github.com/pypa/advisory-database/commit/3a9965376d29097865262e88d0489d1c9176d166)

## OpenSSF Day Europe 2023

* Published slides and did recording of my portion of the talk "Making Python Safer than Ever" with my co-presenter **Cheuk Ting-Ho**.
* Shared the talk and livestream multiple times on social media.
* Woke up early to participate in the live chat for the talk and answer a few questions.

## Other items

* Investigated the "[Bring Your Own Builder](https://slsa.dev/blog/2023/08/bring-your-own-builder-github)" feature from SLSA for applicability to a [Python GitHub Actions builder](https://github.com/di/gh-action-build/issues/9).
* [Opened an issue](https://github.com/pypi-data/data/issues/12) on the new [py-code.org](https://py-code.org) service that gathers all data on PyPI.
  The issue is requesting dependency data from packages and other data I track in my own PyPI dataset.
* Authored the [PSF's CNA processes document](https://github.com/psf/policies/pull/1).
* [Updated pip's security policy](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/12254) to point to [the PSRT webpage](https://python.org/dev/security)
  * The "Supported Versions" that I initially proposed [had some additional discussion](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/12260).
* [Updated `get-pip.py` generation code](https://github.com/pypa/get-pip/pull/196) to verify the digests of downloaded wheels and upgraded the digest method from MD5 to SHA256.
  I don't believe that this has ever historically been an issue, since any "MITM" attack here would have had to succeed over and over again
  in CI to persist and would get committed to the set of commits before deployment, something that hasn't been observed.
* Discussed the release process of pip with pip maintainer **Pradyun Gedam**. Stay tuned for more there.
* Reviewed the [proposal for the PyPI Malware Reporting API](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/14503).
* Reviewed the [Inbound Malware Report post](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-09-18-inbound-malware-reporting/) on PyPI's blog.
* Sigstore v2 and bundles work for `python/release-tools`
  * [python/release-tools#55](https://github.com/python/release-tools/issues/55)
  * [sigstore/sigstore-python#771](https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/issues/771)
  * [python/pythondotorg#2285](https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/issues/2285)
