# Rustls
Our goal is to build a safer TLS library that can largely replace OpenSSL over time. The headline features of the new library, Rustls, are performance and memory safety.

We are making great progress. The community is also growing rapidly, with new contributors showing up regularly and largely representing new consumers of Rustls.

We accomplished a major milestone by releasing the [Platform Verifier](https://github.com/rustls/rustls-platform-verifier#rustls-platform-verifier). 

  - It's a Rust library that verifies the validity of TLS certificates based on the operating system's certificate facilities.   
  - Portions of the Android and Windows implementation were adapted and referenced from Chromium's previous verifier implementations.

We published a [blog post](https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/rustls-performance/) that outlines the work being done to develop strong performance benchmarking tools, and how the results of that benchmarking have informed better engineering decisions for Rustls. 

#Rust for Linux
  
Our goal is to make Rust a supported second language for Linux kernel development, and to foster the creation of drivers and modules written in Rust.

The primary maintainer of Rust for Linux, Miguel Ojeda, has been working full time under contract with Prossimo since April of 2021.

  - Ongoing work for the new build system for the Rust side of the Linux kernel.

  - Preparation for the upcoming Linux kernel 6.8 merge window early January.

  - The PHY reference driver (and its required abstractions) has been
[queued](https://lore.kernel.org/netdev/170263322444.1975.17234929609368010648.git-patchwork-notify@kernel.org/)
through the netdev tree for the next merge window, making it the first
driver written in Rust to land upstream.

  - The [Rust 1.75 version
upgrade](https://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20231224172128.271447-1-ojeda@kernel.org/)
was submitted in advance of the upcoming release of the compiler late
December.

  - Meeting with KernelCI/Collabora around the new dashboard effort
and what could be needed for Rust-related use cases for CI.

  - [Rust for Linux is now in space](https://lwn.net/Articles/954974/)
as part of a satellite just
[launched](https://bupt-os.github.io/website/news/2023_12_9/satellite_launch/)
out of China.
