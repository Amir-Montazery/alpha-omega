# Eclipse Foundation's update â€” July 2023

## GitHub organizations and repositories management

The number of EF projects that has Otterdog enabled has grown to 26 and adoption for using it has considerably increased in the last month. Furthermore, we added support for more GitHub features that can be configured using otterdog (namely github pages configuration, some branch protection rule setting), added some quality of life improvements to the cli tool (e.g. a web-login operation) and worked on the documentation site hosted at otterdog.readthedocs.io. The full list of changes is available at https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/security/otterdog/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md.

## SLSA tools

Preparation have been made to release a first version of the SLSA Jenkins plugin supporting SLSA Provenance version 1.0. The release is supposed to be completed beginning of August.

## Processes improvement

We have continued the improvement of processes among projects. This month we have promoted the usage of SECURITY.md. It has been added for multiple projects (including EE4J) and updated on others to include a link to the GitLab bugtracker. SECURITY.md addition is pending on Eclipse Platform. We have also published a blog post on the need of SECURITY.md: https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/marta-rybczynska/securitymd-should-i-have-it

## Security audits

We have made progress writing audit scope description for the next set of projects.

## Sigstore integration

To commence our experimentation with Sigstore's staging instance, we have successfully deployed Keycloak version 21.1.2. This Keycloak instance operates using a mirror of the current production data. Should this trial prove successful, we plan to schedule an update for the production instance during the maintenance window next month. Additionally, we have also deployed the OIDC endpoint, exclusively for system users, on Eclipse's internal infrastructure.

## Improve scorecard for projects

Some more PRs have been opened / merged to apply some of the best practices as reported by scorecard:

* https://github.com/jakartaee/config/pull/177
* https://github.com/jakartaee/connectors/pull/138
* https://github.com/jakartaee/data/pull/158
* https://github.com/jakartaee/enterprise-beans/pull/150
* https://github.com/jakartaee/faces/pull/1817
* https://github.com/jakartaee/inject/pull/32

## SBOM

We've started an investigation to generate SBOMs for all [Jakarta EE](https://github.com/jakartaee) projects. To accomplish this, we've adopted the [CycloneDX Maven Plugin](https://github.com/CycloneDX/cyclonedx-maven-plugin). Our current focus involves conducting experiments across different Jakarta EE versions, exploring various options to identify how to generate the most precise and accurate SBOMs.
