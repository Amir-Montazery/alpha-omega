# Eclipse Foundation for May 2023

## Audits

The audit of JKube has finished. A fixes review for Eclipse p2 has also been done. For those two audits and the previous ones (Jetty and Mosquitto), we are preparing communication and audit results for publication.

## Security processes

We have announced the new vulnerability reporting methods to all committers. Projects can also apply for GitHub private advisories pilot, we enable the functionality for projects that request it. Project part of the pilot includes:
* Adoptium
* Eclipse Volttron
* OpenHW Group
* Eclipse OpenJ9
* Eclipse Californium

## Sigstore deployment

In order for Eclipse Foundation's signing to be verifiable accross the internet, our Sigstore implementation has been rethought to sign as an identifiable Eclipse authority under the Sigstore Certificate Authority.

## Infrastructure security posture

Some reverse proxy were misconfigured, disabling HSTS for a couple of websites. Fix is being reviewed and tested.

## Visibility of the Eclipse Foundation security team

With the growth of Eclipse Foundation Security Team, more transparency and visibility is required. A page with the contacts of the whole team has been created: https://eclipse.org/security/team.php

## GitHub organizations and repositories management

Various improvements have been made to Otterdog to roll it out at scale to many organizations.

It is now possible to create repositories from a template and sync changes from this template to all repositories that have been created from it. This allows to sync the configuration repository for all organizations with a simple operations.

Additional organizations have been enabled to use otterdog, including [eclipse-pdt](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/2812), [eclipse-jdt](https://www.eclipse.org/lists/jdt-dev/msg02277.html), and [eclipse-tractusx](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/3214).

Additionally, some work has been performed on the user experience:
* the validation workflow will now display with syntax highlighting the changes that are requested as well as also point out the configuration settings that are redundant and can be removed (canonical view);
* the configuration repository for each organization is now public and follows best practices wherever possible (containing CODEOWNERS, branch protection rules and dependabot configuration).

For the next month we plan to roll it out to any project that plans to migrate to GitHub. Additionally, we intensify our effort for automatically applying approve settings changes via a GitHub App.

Otterdog has been publicly presented at Open Source Summit in Vancouver early May:
* [Session](https://ossna2023.sched.com/event/1K5DO/configuration-as-a-code-managing-hundreds-of-github-organizations-to-streamline-supply-chain-security-mikael-barbero-eclipse-foundation)
* [Slides](https://static.sched.com/hosted_files/ossna2023/41/OpenSourceSumit2023%20â€”%20GitOps%20for%20GitHub%20-%20Mikael%20Barbero.pdf)

## SLSA tools / Jenkins plugin
Due to a shift in priority to Otterdog, no progress has been made in the Jenkins plugin, but we plan to complete a first official release next month.
