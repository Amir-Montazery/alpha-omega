# Eclipse Foundation for February 2023

## Two Factor Authentication

[Eclipse Tycho](https://github.com/eclipse-tycho), [Eclipse m2e](https://github.com/eclipse-m2e), and [Eclipse RAP](https://github.com/eclipse-rap) have all enforced 2FA for all their committers on GitHub:
* https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/2701
* https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/2702
* https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/2611

Meanwhile, we've seen an increase of adoption of 2FA globally on all Eclipse Projects at Github, increasing from 64% to 67%. We are now starting to actively enforce 2FA for projects with a dedicated GitHub organization.

## Security Audits

Threat modeling for one out of the three security audits have been completed. Code review is underway. The timeline has been locked in for threat modeling and code review for the second security audit. The schedule of the third one is still a work in progress, but will likely be delayed due to project's constraint. This last one will likely complete in May.

## Hiring

We continue building capacity by adding another Software Engineer to the team. They will be working closely with Eclipse Foundation Projects to enhance their software supply chain security. They will provide guidance to projects, assist with hardening their CI/CD pipelines, configure tools to detect vulnerabilities, and ensure dependencies are up-to-date.

## Rework of the CVE process

We've performed a number of interviews with project leads about the current vulnerability and CVE processes. The common outcome is a request for more detailed documentation and clarification of the process. Proposals for updated documentations are currently under review. More interviews are planned. We've extended the experimentation of GitHub security advisories. We have also worked on a SECURITY.md template for all Eclipse Foundation projects.

## GitHub organizations and repositories management

Some work has been done in order to improve the usability of the tool, codenamed [OtterDog](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/security/otterdog/). The tool will output in a concise way what settings / resources will be changed / created prior to applying the configuration to GitHub by comparing the current live settings on GitHub to the intended configuration.

A credential provider for [pass](https://www.passwordstore.org) has been added to support using the tool for our first organization: [Eclipse CBI](https://github.com/eclipse-cbi/) which hosts various tools and projects for common build infrastructure at the Eclipse Foundation.

## SLSA tools
We started to work on [slsa-tools](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/netomi/slsa-tools) which is a collection of tools written in Java to operate on SLSA provenance files. The idea behind this project is to have a rich set of tools to verify / generate provenance files for the Java ecosystem.

Existing SLSA tools are implemented in Go which make it somewhat cumbersome to use them in certain settings, e.g. to develop a Jenkins plugin to generate provenance files for builds.

The medium-term goal is to develop such a Jenkins plugin with features similar to the existing [slsa-github-generator](https://github.com/slsa-framework/slsa-github-generator/) action for GitHub.
