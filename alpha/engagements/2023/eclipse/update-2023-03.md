# Eclipse Foundation for March 2023

## Two Factor Authentication

We've seen an increase of adoption of 2FA globally on all Eclipse Projects on Github, increasing from 67% to 75%.

The following dedicated GitHub organization have enforced 2FA:

* [Eclipse Sirius](https://github.com/eclipse-sirius): https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/2883
* [Eclipse Scout](https://github.com/eclipse-scout): https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/2806
* [Eclipse EMF](https://github.com/eclipse-emf): https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/2794

## Security processes

We have finished the rework of the Eclipse Foundation vulnerability reporting procedure on the [security website](https://www.eclipse.org/security/) and in the [handbook](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#vulnerability). The new version includes more explanations and details for developers. It also now recommends ``SECURITY.md`` and provides a [template](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/security/best-practices/-/blob/main/templates/SECURITY.md) of that file.

Webinars on vulnerability reporting for staff and contributors are scheduled in April.

## Security audits

The threat modeling and secure code review of both Eclipse Jetty and Eclipse Mosquitto was completed. Completed reports are available to the projectsâ€™ teams (in confidential and draft forms) who are now working on addressing the findings. Publication of the report will depend on the time required to fix the issues. We reasonably expect the report to be published by the end of Q2 2023 or beginning of Q3 2023.

Reviewed candidates for the next round of audit.

## GitHub organizations and repositories management

The main focus was on improving performance of OtterDog and to reduce the number of requests to GitHub in order to be able to roll it out for many more organizations. Additionally support for branch protection rules was extended, supporting most of the available properties (status checks are missing).

Investigation has started to deploy otterdog as a GitHub App to make it easier for projects to apply the tool for their organization / repositories.

## SLSA tools

A first, preliminary version of a jenkins plugin to generate SLSA attestations was created, supporting projects hosted in Git repositories and using a Freestyle project setup. Work continues to capture all build steps that were performed to generate the artifacts to attest and to support also pipeline projects.

## Infrastructure security posture

Since the beginning of the year, we've using UpGuard to monitor our public assets. Through UpGuard's continuous monitoring capabilities, we have been able to identify and mitigate various security issues during the first quarter. The tool has provided us with valuable insights and alerts, empowering the team to take swift action to address any potential risks before they become critical. We have worked diligently to remediate the issues identified by UpGuard, ensuring that our infrastructure remains resilient and protected against potential cyber threats.

As of 31 March, our organization's score on the UpGuard platform was 849 out of 950, up from 776 last January. It is higher than the industry average of 738 for the software development industry. This score is based on the scan of 771 domains and IPs, 224 of which were considered active. The platform categorizes risks, and while our lowest score is still in the email category, it has greatly improved, moving up from 587 to 693.
