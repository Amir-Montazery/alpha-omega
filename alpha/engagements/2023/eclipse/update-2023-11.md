The full list of changes is available in our [CHANGELOG](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/security/otterdog/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md). 

## Security Audit

We have published the security audit report for [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mikael.barbero.tech/blog/post/2023-11-28-eclipse-mosquitto-security-audit-results/). The audit revealed a few issues in the password implementation and Dynamic Security plugin.

## Vulnerabilities publication

We have published a number of vulnerabilities for various projects:

* [CVE-2023-5676](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-5676)	[Eclipse OpenJ9](https://eclipse.dev/openj9/) (alternative JVM implementation)
* [CVE-2023-4218](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-4218)	[Eclipse Platform](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/eclipse.platform) (foundation of the Eclipse IDE/RCP)

## Internal Infrastructure Security Improvement 

* The implementation of 2FA for committers on https://gitlab.eclipse.org has been [finalized](https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/helpdesk/-/issues/1251). The deadline for this requirement was December 4th, making 2FA mandatory for all committers with projects on gitlab.eclipse.org.
* Regarding GitHub, 87% of committers associated with projects hosted at GitHub have already activated 2FA on their accounts at github.com. A final phase for enforcing 2FA across all organizations on GitHub is planned for early in the first quarter of 2024.
