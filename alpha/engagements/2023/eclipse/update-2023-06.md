# Eclipse Foundation's update â€” June 2023

## Hiring

We are further enhancing our capabilities by welcoming Michael Winser to our team as a Cybersecurity Ambassador. He will be promoting the security initiatives of the Eclipse Foundation and shaping the Foundation's security narrative through the delivery of whitepapers and articles.

## GitHub organizations and repositories management
We have now successfully applied Otterdog to 14 organizations at the Eclipse Foundation (https://eclipsefdn.github.io/otterdog-configs/) and plan to roll it out by default to all projects that migrate to GitHub. On top of that, we have recently added support for additional resources that can be handled by Otterdog, namely Action Secrets and Environments. Further work is ongoing to fully automate applying of settings via a GitHub App. A full list of changes is available at https://gitlab.eclipse.org/eclipsefdn/security/otterdog/-/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md.

## SLSA tools

Due to a shift in priority to Otterdog, no progress has been made in the Jenkins plugin last month.
