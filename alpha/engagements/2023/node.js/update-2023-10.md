# Update 2023-10

This is a summary of the work accomplished in the Alpha-Omega project October 2023
in the Node.js scope.

## Summary

October was a monthly quite busy due to the latest security release affecting Node.js 18 and Node.js 20.
A day after the security release, we've released a new major version of Node.js, 21.

### Security Release

In response to the latest security concerns, Node.js promptly addressed 4 CVEs within Node.js itself and 2 in its dependencies,
namely `undici` and `nghttp2`. The vulnerabilities were categorized as follows:

- 2 High severity issues
- 1 Medium severity issue
- 1 Low severity issue in Node.js
- Security updates for `undici` and `nghttp2`

The 20.x release line of Node.js was vulnerable to 2 high severity issues, 1 medium severity issue, and 1 low severity issue.
The 18.x release line of Node.js was vulnerable to 1 medium severity issue, and 1 low severity issue.

For detailed information, refer to the security release blog post: [October 2023 Security Releases](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/october-2023-security-releases).
Users can check their version's vulnerability status by running:

```console
$ npx is-my-node-vulnerable
```

In addition to the security release, some tiny adjusts were made to the next-security-release template:

* https://github.com/nodejs/node-core-utils/pull/744
* https://github.com/nodejs/node-core-utils/pull/739

As a fact of curiosity, this security release was very quickly in time due to the upcoming major release.
It took just 3 days of work! Usually, we lock the CI for at least 5 days. This was only possible due to the recent
changes to the CITGM and the automation of the security release proposal.

### Node.js 21

October was the month we released a new major version of Node.js. Major releases take a significant amount of work
to collect and condense all the information to the community.

Node.js 21 comes with interesting updates to ESM, stable version of `fetch` and `WebStreams` and many more.
See our [release post](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v21-release-announce).
Also note this means a transition from Node.js 20 to LTS and Node.js 21 as our 'Current' release.

### Security initiatives and assessments

Recently, OpenSSL disclosed 3 security releases which were assessed by the Node.js team
as a non-critical patch, therefore, they were handled in regular releases.

The assessment was published at: https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/openssl-fixes-in-regular-releases-oct2023.

Apart from that, two pull requests were created to update the Permission Model stability (moving it to 1.1 - Active development)
and to document some files that can be read before the V8 initializaton - affecting direct the Permission Model

1. https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/50068
2. https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/50072

With the intention of improving the scorecard of different repositories under Node.js organization, we've
created 5 pull requests to pin github actions by commit-hash:

1. https://github.com/nodejs/diagnostics/pull/621
2. https://github.com/nodejs/build/pull/3516
3. https://github.com/nodejs/citgm/pull/1010
4. https://github.com/nodejs/llhttp/pull/255
5. https://github.com/nodejs/undici/pull/2325

We are evaluating how effective this approach is for non-libraries since it can cause some maintenance burden
to the maintainers. Consider that you can pin github actions by tag without having to manually (or through dependabot)
update semver-minor and semver-patch releases -- `actions/checkout@v2` will always fetch the latest release of v2.

In October, we've added support Ada and `simdtuf` to our [dependency-vulnerability-scanner](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments)
through the [#158 PR](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments/pull/158) and Node.js 21 was added to the
cycle.

As a final update, we've identified that a previous security release might have broken the usage of `esm` npm package, however,
considering this package is now _archieved_ and the usage of monkey patching isn't guaranteed by Node.js, it's unlikely to have a patch for that.
