# Update 2023-10

## releases.jquery.com

releases.jquery.com has added [protections against cache-pass requests](https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet/issues/28), or POST requests that bypassed the cache. Also, the web-based cron job, which runs a POST request, has been disabled and a new systemd cron job has been added to run the cron job as a GET request.

## jQuery CDN migration

A few last clean-up tasks have been completed for the [jQuery CDN migration](https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet/issues/30). The sponsership note has been updated to Fastly in the jQuery footers and on the releases.jquery.com homepage.

## jQuery Blog

For a long time, the jQuery blog [could not store non-ASCII characters in the database](https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet/issues/11). This has been fixed by changing the database character set to `utf8mb4` and the collation to `utf8mb4_general_ci`. The most notable advantage for the jQuery team is we can now spell "Michał Gołębiowski-Owczarek".

## robots.txt for jQuery staging sites

The robots.txt has been updated to [disable indexing for jQuery staging sites](https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet/issues/32). This will prevent search engines from indexing staging sites, which are not intended for public use.

## Upgrade PHP on wordpress hosts

All wordpress hosts have been [upgraded to Wordpress 6 and PHP 8](https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet/issues/6). Domains include:

- https://jquery.com
- https://api.jquery.com
- https://learn.jquery.com
- https://blog.jquery.com
- https://blog.jqueryui.com
- https://blog.jquerymobile.com
- https://*.jquery.org
- https://*.jqueryui.com
- https://*.jquerymolbile.com
- https://releases.jquery.com

## Trac droplets decommissioned

Static archives of the Trac instances have been created and the Trac droplets have been decommissioned. The archives are available at: https://bugs.jquery.com and https://bugs.jqueryui.com. DNS settings, tarsnap backups, and Puppet provisions have also been removed. The static archives still support search for tickets and milestones.

## Typesense migration


Migration from Algolia to self-hosted Typesense [has been completed for the jQuery docs sites](https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet/issues/33). Search results have been improved by preferring to show matching pages rather than each match of the search term on one page. It reduces the number of third-party requests. Also, it improves page load time performance by switching from the docsearch.js package to the 2kB [typesense-minibar](https://github.com/jquery/typesense-minibar) component.
