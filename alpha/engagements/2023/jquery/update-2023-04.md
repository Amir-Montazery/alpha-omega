# Update 2023-04

## 1) Infrastructure

### 1.1 Blog sites

The blogs service hosts WordPress sites for https://blog.jquery.com, blog.jqueryui.com, and blog.jquerymobile.com.
The blog sites are fully switched over to the new server that we set up last month. The two old blog servers are ready for decommission.

### 1.2 Documentation sites
The jQuery project has over 20 documentation sites that publish content from public Git repositories.
These sites are currently hosted on a cluster of 6 droplets (2 builders and 4 webservers).
Each webserver runs a single WordPress "multisite" instance that serves multiple sites from a single shared docroot and database.
These servers are also run an older WordPress version, with outdated versions of several plugins, and have a fair bit of customization
specific to jQuery.com sites (such as the "gilded-wordpress" plugin that was custom made for jQuery).

Work began last month in setting up a new staging builder and a new staging webserver, running the latest Debian LTS.
The WP-CLI tool was chosen to help automate management of each site as its own standalone WordPress install.
The first site being transitioned to this server is https://learn.jquery.com.
Several patches are needed to packages part of the build process ([SNI for node-wordpress](https://github.com/scottgonzalez/node-wordpress/pull/76)),
WordPress plugins ([gilded-wordpress patch](https://github.com/scottgonzalez/gilded-wordpress/pull/6)),
and our theme code ([remove server-side inclusion of cross-site file](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/commit/f90482a71db6241c01e2bdad8014b3397a1fdfb9)).
These are either to support the latest stable WordPress, to support encrypting uploads over HTTPS,
or to support running as a standalone WordPress site.

### 1.3 Search

The jQuery documentation sites rely on the legacy version of the Algolia DocSearch hosted service,
and indexed by a deprecated version of Algolia docsearch-scraper.

After [evaluating different solutions](https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet/blob/staging/doc/search.md#background),
we began last month on providing a free software solution with [Typesense](https://typesense.org/). A Typesense API server has been
provisioned and ready for use at typesense.jquery.com.
The JavaScript integration for WordPress and Jekyll/Amethyst is taking shape at https://github.com/jquery/typesense-minibar.  

## 2) Ecosystem Risk Audit
