# Update 2023-02

## 1) Infrastructure

### 1.1) Codeorigin

The codeorigin service hosts the data served via the main jQuery CDN
(code.jquery.com). This month the codeorigin service was switched over
to servers on the new infrastructure. The old server is still online as
it hosts other websites that are pending to be moved to the new
infrastructure.

### 1.2) TestSwarm

The TestSwarm service is used to perform automatic browser testing for
jQuery. This month the new TestSwarm server was tested successfully
using database data migrated from the old server, including the
BrowserStack integration service (aka testswarm-browserstack).

The new server is running PHP 7.4 and Node.js v12 from the latest
stable Debian release, compared to the old server running PHP 5.6 and
Node.js v10.
