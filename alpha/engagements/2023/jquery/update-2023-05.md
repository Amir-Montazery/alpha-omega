# Update 2023-05

## 1) Infrastructure

### 1.1 Documentation sites

The jQuery project has over 20 documentation sites that publish content from public Git repositories. These sites are currently hosted on a cluster of 6 droplets (2 builders, 4 webservers). Each webserver runs a single WordPress "multisite" instance that serves multiple sites from a single shared docroot and database. These servers are also run an older WordPress version, with outdated versions of several plugins, and have a fair bit of customization specific to jQuery.com sites. Last month the "learn.jquery.com" site was migrated to validate the approach and address any general compatibility issues.

This month work started on porting a second, more complicated site to the new infrastructure. The second site chosen was https://api.jqueryui.com and its version-specific subsites. Specific plugins, configurations, and other features needed by this type of site are being ported to standalone WordPress and provisioned via https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet.

### 1.2 Legacy issue tracker

Work has begun on archiving the Trac sites. A first version of the static dumps has been successfully generated and published at https://github.com/jquery/bugs.jquery.com and https://github.com/jquery/bugs.jqueryui.com. Remaining work includes a database dump of relevant tables to CSV/JSON for future use, and a minimal static site with static search to browse the issues at their original locations for URL compatibility.

### 1.3 Search

The jQuery documentation sites rely on the legacy version of the Algolia DocSearch hosted service, and indexed by a deprecated version of Algolia docsearch-scraper. Our [replacement strategy](https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet/blob/staging/doc/search.md#background) is to migrate to a free software solution with Typesense. Last month, the JavaScript frontend was developed at https://github.com/jquery/typesense-minibar.

This month, the [integration for Jekyll Amethyst](https://github.com/qunitjs/jekyll-theme-amethyst) was developed, and has been deployed to https://qunitjs.com as first site using the new self-hosted Typesense server and new [typesense-minibar](https://github.com/jquery/typesense-minibar) frontend.
