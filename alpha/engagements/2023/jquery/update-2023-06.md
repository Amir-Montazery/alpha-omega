# Update 2023-06

## 1) Infrastructure

### 1.1 Documentation sites

Work continued on creating staging versions of the 20 documentation web sites on the new WordPress infrastructure.

Multiple patches were made to sites to allow building on the new infrastructure, including "jquery.com" and "releases.jquery.com".

In addition, we made progress on modernizing the automation system that configures all our WordPress instances.
To aid in verifying changes before deployment and to ease contributions in the future,
the stale and broken Vagrant-based workflow has been replaced with a new Docker-based workflow at https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-docker. 

### 1.2 Miscweb

This month server provisions were developed to support easy management of redirect URLs and redirect domain names,
to support our many existing [Cool URLs](https://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI),
including on non-canonical domains, and on subpaths within WordPress-managed doc sites.

This will allow much of the remaining web traffic to old server infrastructure to be moved to the new servers.

### 1.3 Legacy issue tracker

Work continued on archiving the Trac sites.
Two static sites have been developed that publish the Track issue exports into web-readable format.
The sites resemble the styling of Trac with an added banner indicating that this is a read-only snapshot.

Previews available at https://jquery.github.io/bugs.jquery.com/ and https://jquery.github.io/bugs.jqueryui.com/.
Source code at https://github.com/jquery/bugs.jquery.com and https://github.com/jquery/bugs.jqueryui.com.
These will later be deployed to the original canonical domains for URL compatibility.

### 1.4 Typesense search

The "Algolia Free" account used by Jekyll-based sites has been disabled.
Our Jekyll sites (e.g. https://qunitjs.com) have completed migration to Typesense ([strategy document](https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet/blob/staging/doc/search.md)).

The WordPress themes for jQuery were improved ([patch](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/commit/4448a54b736949dbbed7909eb3a37716c3e9d66e))
to better separate the Algolia Docsearch integration in preparation for gradually migrating these to Typesense. 

## 2) Ecosystem Risk Audit

IDC presented the final survey results readout for the jQuery and foundation team.
The team will be taking this information and packaging it up for communications content for the Web Modernization Campaign.
