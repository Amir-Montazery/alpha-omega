## Decommissioning plugins.jquery.com

Work has begun on decommissioning the plugins.jquery.com droplet and wordpress site. The site will be migrated to a static archive that still supports searching plugins and tags. The archive will be hosted for free as a static site.

## Healthy Web Campaign

In phase one of the Healthy Web campaign, we [released the results](https://openjsf.org/blog/openjs-foundation-reports-poor-security-practices-across) of an end-user risk audit based on an IDC survey that shows three-quarters of a billion websites are running out of date software. The key findings were presented by Robin Bender Ginn in a keynote at the Open Source in Finance Forum in New York City on November 1. Phase two of the campaign will go live in early 2024.
