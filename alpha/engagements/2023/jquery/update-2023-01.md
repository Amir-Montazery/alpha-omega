# Update 2023-01

## Infrastructure

### Puppet infrastructure

New tooling was created to ease management of [Tarsnap][] backup keys
across all jQuery servers using Puppet. Also, the private Git
repository for infrastructure secrets, which is stored on the Puppet
server only, is now being backed up.

### Contentorigin

The contentorigin service hosts some static assets. During this month,
the configuration for this new server was finalized and the data was
moved from the old server to the new one. After that was complete,
traffic was switched on the CDN layer to the new server and the old one
was shut down.

### TestSwarm

The TestSwarm service is used to perform automatic browser testing for
jQuery. It is being migrated to a new server in the new infrastructure.
The new server was set up and configured, and it is pending testing and
data migration.
