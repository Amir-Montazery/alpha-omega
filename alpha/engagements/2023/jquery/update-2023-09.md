## jQuery CDN migration from StackPath to Fastly

The jQuery CDN has been successfully migrated from StackPath to Fastly. Domains with less traffic, such as [releases.jquery.com](https://releases.jquery.com), codeorigin.jquery.com, static.jquery.com, and content.jquery.com, were migrated in August.

The primary domain at https://code.jquery.com was switched over on Friday, September 15th. This completes our migration! Details at <https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet/issues/30>.

## WordPress doc sites

Legacy server droplets (wp-02 and wp-03) have been decommissioned (details at https://github.com/jquery/infrastructure-puppet/issues/6). The following sites have been migrated to the new infrastructure:

- https://jquery.com
- https://api.jquery.com
- https://jqueryui.com
- https://api.jqueryui.com
- https://jquery.org/
- https://meetings.jquery.org/
- https://brand.jquery.org/
- https://contribute.jquery.org/

[jquery-wp-content](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content), jQuery's custom WordPress theme, has been updated to convert "MU" and "multi-site" plugins into standalone WordPress plugins. This will make it easier to maintain and update the theme. The [jquery-wp-docker](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-docker) development environment has been refactored to work with the new standalone WordPress model. Installation instructions have been updated according to new production servers.

## Decomission CLA droplets

Last month, we completed the steps to decommission legacy CLA droplets. The last step was to delete the droplets. This has now been done. Redirects have also been added to the old CLA domains to point to the new CLA service.

## Modernizing jQuery Core test infrastructure

### Grunt migration

Grunt migrations for both main and 3.x branches have been completed! The only exceptions are the tasks that use Karma Runner.

main branch: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/2bdecf8b7bd10864e5337a4e24e39476c78cf23a

3.x-stable branch: https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/ec8802bafefaebd99e4bfc0956fb409d9054d871

### CI migration

We'll be working to migrate our testing infrastructure off an old Jenkins server and onto GitHub Actions. This will involve migrating the QUnit tests off of Karma, and possibly off of TestSwarm as well. The build process has already been migrated to npm scripts and a new command line tool.

In order to migrate our usage of BrowserStack off Karma, we looked into using BrowserStack's latest SDK. However, their current tooling does not support QUnit, but they may add support for it in the future. After discussing the best course with the BrowserStack team, they recommended we continue using their legacy package for running JS tests. We'll revisit this once their new SDK supports QUnit.
