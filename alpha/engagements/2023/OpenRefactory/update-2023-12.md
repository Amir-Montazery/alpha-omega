* A high severity bug is any one of the following: (1) An injection related bug, (2) a weak cryptography related bug, (3) an access control related bug (4) a security or a reliability bug that is typically of medium priority but has been categorized as a high prioriy bug because it is found in a popular project (100+ forks).
