In the month of November, the engineers at OpenRefactory focused on Python, Java, and Go projects. We first show the work done month over month. This is followed by the cumulative results. Finally we show language specific breakdown of the cumulative results.

In November, 36 new security and reliability bugs were filed, including various injection issues, weak cryptography issues, unsafe library call (`mktemp`, `mkstemp`) related issues, file permission issues, data races and null pointer dereferences. 


## Series of Blog Posts

A static analysis tool flags a deviation of safe coding practices as a bug. But sometimes developers may want to adopt an unsafe option deliberately. This causes a lot of contention --- A bug in theory may not be a bug in practice. As shown in the tables above, very few bugs that have been filed by the OpenRefactory security team have been rejected (~5%). This is because the security team has explored many such contentious bug categories in depth to understand how developers use certain language options. This is the insight that we are receiving from the everyday feedback from various maintainers. We have collected those thoughts and have created a series of blog posts on various issues. 

* [Crash ! Boom ! Bang ! What Happens When A Serializable Object Contains a Non-Serializable Field?](https://www.openrefactory.com/crash-boom-bang-what-happens-when-a-serializable-object-contains-a-non-serializable-field/) - On how to do serialization properly in Java (November 2023)
* [When All Things Are Not Equal](https://www.openrefactory.com/when-all-things-are-not-equal/) - On the use of `equals(Object)` and `hashCode()` methods in Java (October 2023) 
* [Don't Eat The Pickle!](https://www.openrefactory.com/dont-eat-the-pickle/) - On the use of `pickle` library in Python (August 2023)

Consider the latest post on Java serialization. We have encountered numerous inconsistencies in the utilization of Serialization-Deserialization within many well-known open source projects. We found that in many projects a `Serializable` class is declared but it contains a non-`Serializable` field. At first glance, the code may not appear to have significant security implications. However, our findings suggest otherwise. These issues have the potential to lead to program crashes during runtime and, in more severe cases, can result in greater security vulnerabilities, including the possibility of remote code execution through insecure deserialization.
