Engineering continues to dominate the Alpha-Omega funded security initiative for the Rust Foundation. Crates.io and threat modeling continue to be the top priorities. 

## crates.io Engineering

The engineering staff at the Rust Foundation continues to work on engineering efforts directly related to security:

### crates.io admin console

The first [crates.io admin console](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/6353) is complete and about to be made public. This console will allow for the ability to easily do security-related administrative tasks for crates.io, and quickly and nimbly react to potential incidents (e.g., yank crates).

### Improved API tokens for crates.io

Following the [work](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/5443) of API token scopes that was completed in June, including a descriptive [blog post](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2023/05/09/api-token-scopes.html) of that work, more [improvements](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/06/23/improved-api-tokens-for-crates-io.html) were made to API tokens, including the ability to set expiration dates for them.

### Crate Quarantine RFC

The initial [RFC](https://hackmd.io/@LawnGnome/B11M9KA8h) for the ability to quarantine crates, after a set of security thresholds have been met, has been written. This will allow the ability to keep a crate in a holding pattern from public use while security checks are made within the crates.io infrastructure to ensure its safety.

### Surfacing crates.io security information

Discussion continues on the [proposal](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/6397) to proactively display crates.io security information on every Rust crate. Proposed for the initial version are surfacing the following pieces of information: the result of any checks run on the crate (the most recent version, in the case of the unversioned crate version), and — if present — the security policy in the SECURITY.md file in the repo.

### crates.io technical debt reduction

More work reducing the amount of general technical debt for crates.io occurred over the last month. There were a bunch of broken crate files stored on S3 that were removed. Fixes for [URLs with a `+`](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/4891) are being implemented and merged. 

## Threat Modeling

Here is the progress on the four threat models being developed by the Rust Foundation:

1. **crates.io**: Potential outline developed.
2. **Crates ecosystem**: Public publication in July.
3. **Rust Project**: Potential outline developed.
4. **Rust Infrastructure**: First draft in progress. Out for internal review in July.

### Threat Model Engineering

Painter, a project to create a complete call graph across all crates in order to better understand how crates relate to each other and more easily assess potential or active risks to other crates if there is a vulnerability in one crate, will soon go public, potentially in July. Discussion continues around disaster recovery and incident response options, specifically how we handle backups and logs.

### Security Analysis Platform

The Foundation was donated access to [Wiz](https://wiz.io), a platform to locate and help mitigate security issues in cloud infrastructure.

## Community and Industry

Tobias wrote a [blog post](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/06/23/improved-api-tokens-for-crates-io.html) about the updated improvements to the API Token Scopes.

Stemming from the PyPI subpoena requests, the Rust Foundation posted a crates.io team written [post](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/a-note-on-data-retention-data-privacy-standards-from-the-crates-io-team/) around crates.io data retention and privacy.

The Rust Foundation is hosting its [first Rust Global event](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/rust-foundation-to-host-inaugural-rust-global-event-at-wasmcon-2023/) at WASMCon 2023.

The next [Community Grants Program Fellowship applications closed on June 30](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2023-rust-foundation-fellowship-application-open-through-june-30/), where some of the potential work is directly related to the security initiative and being mentored by Foundation engineers.

Security Initiative public report first draft in progress. The Director of Communications and Marketing is working with the Foundation's engineering team to curate the content for publication.
