As we head into June 2023, the key work around the Alpha-Omega funded security initiative for the Rust Foundation remains engineering focused. Work around crates.io and threat modeling continue to be the top priorities. 

## crates.io Engineering

The engineering staff at the Rust Foundation continues to work on engineering efforts directly related to security:

### crates.io admin console

Following the development of the initial [prototype](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/6353) of the crates.io admin console, work continues in support of it. From, improvements to the infrastructure to [support the actual development](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/6437) of the console to [implementing security](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/6456) around who has access to it, the console is coming together for potential use.

### Surfacing crates.io security information

Discussion continues on the [proposal](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/6397) to proactively display crates.io security information on every Rust crate. Proposed for the initial version are surfacing the following pieces of information: the result of any checks run on the crate (the most recent version, in the case of the unversioned crate version), and — if present — the security policy in the SECURITY.md file in the repo.

### crates.io token scope improvements

[Work](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/5443) on crates.io [token scope improvements](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2947) continues. This month, additional token sections were added: [crates](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/6432) and [scopes](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/6428). There is now the ability to [display](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/6450) existing tokens. All this work was [announced](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2023/05/09/api-token-scopes.html) on the Inside Rust blog.

### crates.io technical debt reduction

More work reducing the amount of general technical debt for crates.io occurred over the last month. From [ensuring consistent a toolchain on development](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/6445) to [adding priorities to tasks](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/6524), crates.io continues to become more stable to users and welcoming to those wanting to contribute to the crates.io project.

## Threat Modeling

Here is the progress on the four threat models being developed by the Rust Foundation:

1. **crates.io**: Potential outline developed.
2. **Crates ecosystem**: Completed. Initial private review met with good reaction. The private review has been broadened to a larger scope of members with interest in the Foundation's security initiative. Initial reaction there positive. After this review and any incorporated feedback, plans for publication will commence.
3. **Rust Project**: Potential outline developed.
4. **Rust Infrastructure**: First draft in progress, with an assessment and initial threat model outlined.

### Threat Model Engineering

As the security threat models are being completed and reviewed, engineering is spinning up to support work coming out of those threat models. The code has been written to create a complete call graph across all crates in order to better understand how crates relate to each other and more easily assess potential or active risks to other crates if there is a vulnerability in one crate. We have plans to make this code public, but there is real interest in this work being used by companies invested in Rust, even outside the Rust Security space. Discussion and planning has also begun around disaster recovery and incident response options, specifically how we handle backups and logs.

## Community and Industry

Given the recent developments at the Python Software Foundation around [PyPi subpoenas](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2023-05-24-pypi-was-subpoenaed/), we are evaluating a proper response from the Foundation that expresses appreciation for how they handled this action and, as a result, proactive actions we are looking at taking.

The [OpenSSF Day North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/openssf-day-north-america/program/schedule/) panel featuring Walter Pearce is now [available for viewing](https://youtu.be/vNqA5Qo0nnE).

The Foundation is considering implementing a practice of publishing a wider, and more visible, report about the Security Initiative twice per year (in addition to a dedicated section in the annual report). The Director of Communications and Marketing will be taking a first pass at the copy for this report in the next month for internal review and consideration by the Technology Team at the Foundation.
