# Rust Foundation Update: March 2023

## Hiring

We are excited to report we have made offers to two candidates to fill our security initiative software engineering roles -  one of which will focus on supporting [crates.io](https://app.beapplied.com/apply/opunkltxxb) and the other on assisting [Walter Pearce](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/welcoming-our-new-security-engineer-walter-pearce/) with [security work](https://app.beapplied.com/apply/rh4qfd8npx). The first has a planned start date in mid-March and the other in early April. Introductions with more specifics to come when they officially come onboard.

## Threat Model

The Foundation's Rust Ecosystem security threat model development is in full force, with Walter taking the lead. After discussions with members of the Rust Project and others in the Rust community, themes have developed and documentation is now being written to describe potential areas of focus and concern. We expect an initial draft of the threat model to be complete by April.

## Potential Top 3 Security Focus Areas

As the threat model is being developed, a theme is emerging around where might be the best areas to focus engineering time and resources.

- Administration tools for crates.io
- Auditable logging within the infrastructure
- Ecosystem scanning

These are purposely high-level at this point, and are not yet set in complete stone since the threat model is still being developed, but are they are likely candidates.
