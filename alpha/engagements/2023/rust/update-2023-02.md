# Rust Foundation Update: February 2023

## Hiring

We are excited to report that our new Security Engineer, Walter Pearce, has begun his first week at the Rust Foundation! You can learn more about Walter via the Foundation's [blog](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/welcoming-our-new-security-engineer-walter-pearce/). We were able to create this role thanks to support from OpenSSF's Alpha-Omega project as part of the [Foundation's Security Initiative](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-13-rust-foundation-establishes-security-team/). 

Additionally, we are in the midst of interviewing for two software engineering roles â€” one of which will focus on supporting [crates.io](https://app.beapplied.com/apply/opunkltxxb) and the other on assisting Walter with [security work](https://app.beapplied.com/apply/rh4qfd8npx).

## Setting the Threat Modeling Analysis Stage

Walter Pearce, the Foundation's new Security Engineer, began meeting with members of relevant teams within the Rust Project in order to gauge what areas of security are bubbling up to the top as high impact. These meetings continue and will be super valuable as Walter achieves one of his first goals - a general threat modeling analysis of the Rust Project and ecosystem, and associated recommednations.

## GitHub Security Scanning Partnership

The Foundation and the Rust Project (specifically crates.io) are now a GitHub technology partner as a [secret scanning integrator](https://github.blog/changelog/2023-01-19-the-crate-io-registry-is-now-a-github-secret-scanning-integrator/). GitHub will scan every commit to a public repository for exposed crates.io keys. GitHub will forward any tokens found to crates.io, who will automatically disable the tokens and notify their owners.
