The first Rust Foundation [security initiative report](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/new-rust-foundation-report-details-security-initiative-progress/) was created this month, which summarizes its progress since the inception of the program. The Foundation plans to publish these reports regularly.

In addition to the report, proposed policies and engineering work directly related to Rust security continued, including the public release of [Painter](https://github.com/rustfoundation/painter/).

## Threat Modeling

Here is the progress on the four threat models being developed by the Rust Foundation:

1. **crates.io**: Outline complete. First threat ranking in progress.
2. **Crates ecosystem**: Public publication pending.
3. **Rust Project**: Potential outline developed.
4. **Rust Infrastructure**: First draft in final stages. Out for internal review by first week of August.

### Crate signing

Discussions have picked up again about how to best go about establishing a public key infrastructure (PKI) for crates and appropriately signing them. This needs to be done in order to consider an official mirror of crates.io, for example.

## Engineering

The technical staff at the Rust Foundation continues to work on engineering efforts directly related to security:

### Painter

The Rust Foundation's first technical open source project has been released to the public. [Painter](https://github.com/rustfoundation/painter/) is a library, with associated tools, for creating and managing Rust ecosystem wide call graphs and llvm-ir analysis.

The graph database created from Painter provides a visualization of dependencies and invocations between all crates within the [crates.io](https://crates.io) ecosystem.

Painter can be used in security situations where, for example, you know of malicious code in a crate and you want to know what other crates use or call that specific piece of code.

Work will continue on Painter within the Foundation and now with the community as well.

### crates.io admin console

The first [crates.io admin console](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/6353) is complete and about to be made public. This console will allow for the ability to easily do security-related administrative tasks for crates.io, and quickly and nimbly react to potential incidents (e.g., yank crates).

### Crate Quarantine RFC

The Crate quarantine [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3464) is now officially open for discussion and comment. If approved and implemented, this weill add an off-by-default quarantine system to crates.io that can be used to prevent crate versions from being immediately published to the crate index based on rules defined by the crates.io team.

### Surfacing crates.io security information

New discussion continues on the [proposal](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/6397) to proactively display crates.io security information on every Rust crate. 

Proposed for the initial version are surfacing the following pieces of information: the result of any checks run on the crate (the most recent version, in the case of the non-versioned crate version), and â€” if present â€” the security policy in the SECURITY.md file in the repo.

There is a recommendation to [integrate the OpenSSF scorecard](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/6397#issuecomment-1646279832) into this work, along with [adding SLSA compliance](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/6397#issuecomment-1646286015) as a surface metric as well.

### crates.io technical debt reduction

More work reducing the amount of general technical debt for crates.io occurred over the last month. There were additional broken and squatted crate files that were cleaned up and the crates.io codebase was [migrated](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/6702) to use the `object_store` crate for file uploads. 

## Community and Industry

The first Rust Foundation Security Initiative [public report](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/new-rust-foundation-report-details-security-initiative-progress/) is available to the public. ðŸŽ‰ This report showcases all of the wonderful work, people and sponsors that are making this initiative possible. The Rust Foundation Director of Communications and Marketing, Gracie Gregory led this publication and there are plans to publish these at a regular cadence.

There is an [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3463) proposed to update the Terms of Use for crates.io based on prior work by other package managers such as PyPI and npm.

The Rust Foundation is hosting its [first Rust Global event](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/rust-foundation-to-host-inaugural-rust-global-event-at-wasmcon-2023/) at WASMCon 2023. The [schedule] is being finalized and the Rust Foundation is planning a technical panel.

The next [Community Grants Program Fellowship applications closed on June 30](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2023-rust-foundation-fellowship-application-open-through-june-30/) and the next round of Fellows have been chosen and notified.
