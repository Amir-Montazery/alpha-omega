The holidays and staff PTO made this a slower month than usual, but there are a couple of highlights from the Rust Foundation.

The Foundation is [coordinating](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/417663-tbd-signing/) with the Rust Project and other stakeholders to improve supply chain security in the Rust ecosystem. We [released](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2023-12-21-improving-supply-chain-security/) a first draft of an artifact signing strategy. We want to ensure that Rust crates and releases can be verified in a secure, low overhead manner. Expect a series of RFCs associated with this strategy to be forthcoming and implementation to begin in 2024.

[Typomania](https://github.com/rustfoundation/typomania) caught yet another malicious, typosquatting based crate, which was yanked within minutes of being published.
