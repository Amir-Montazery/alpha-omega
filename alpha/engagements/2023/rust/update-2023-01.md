# Rust Foundation Update: January 2023

## Hiring

The Rust Foundation posted a [security engineer role](https://app.beapplied.com/apply/uaipojabpu) in November 2022. It received multiple applications and after interviewing a subset of those candidates, an offer has been made and accepted. The person hired for this role is planned to start on 30 January 2023 and will be the first engineer for the [Foundation’s Security Initiative](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-13-rust-foundation-establishes-security-team/).

## Additional Funding

As a result of the formation of the [Foundation’s Security Initiative](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-13-rust-foundation-establishes-security-team/), the Foundation was able to leverage additional funding from a generous donation from AWS. This funding will be partly used to hire two software engineers to help support the initiative through work on [crates.io](https://app.beapplied.com/apply/opunkltxxb) and [general security work](https://app.beapplied.com/apply/rh4qfd8npx) in the Rust Project and ecosystem.

## Initial Focus

With the Security Engineer onboard, and the software engineers forth-coming, the initial focus for the security initiative work will be two-fold. One will be to do a general threat modeling analysis of the Rust Project and ecosystem. The second, more specific area of work, will be to develop a proposal for an official mechanism for certifying Rust code (e.g., crates) as officially audited for security vulnerabilities. This proposal will be formulated and reviewed in conjunction with the Rust Project.

## Potential Security Issue Discovered

In addition to Alpha-Omega, JFrog was the other partner in the creation of the Foundation’s Security Initiative. JFrog has provided engineering resources from its own security research team. One result from this work is a potential security issue discovered when using a highly used crate, Hyper, that could cause a Denial of Service (DOS) attack. This discovery is written in detail in this [blog post](https://jfrog.com/blog/watch-out-for-dos-when-using-rusts-popular-hyper-package/).
