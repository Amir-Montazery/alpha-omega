# Rust Foundation Update: March 2023

## Hiring

The Rust Foundation would like to welcome two new engineering hires to its staff, [Adam Harvey](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/welcoming-software-engineer-adam-harvey-to-the-rust-foundation-team/) and Tobias Bieniek. Both will be doing software development as part of our [security initiative](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-13-rust-foundation-establishes-security-team/), from crates.io to the general crates ecosystem and beyond. 

As of now, these will be our last hires in 2023 as it relates to the current security initiative.

## Threat Modeling

Four threat models are being established by the Foundation. These four include crates.io, the crates ecosystem, the Rust Project, and Rust Infrastructure. The first drafts of two of these threat models (crates ecosystem and general Rust Project) are complete and are being delivered to trusted security stakeholders for review and feedback.

## Engineering

One of the first software engineering work items as part of the security initiative is an admin console for crates.io. We want to have the ability to easily do security-related administrative tasks for crates.io, and quickly and nimbly react to potential incidents. This will allow for the Rust Project to perform actions such as take more proactive actions with suspect crates, or just easily see information about a crate or how it was published, etc. The full outline of the plan is [here](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/318791-t-crates-io/topic/crates.2Eio.20admin.20area.20plan/near/345749878).

In addition, there is work reducing crates.io technical debt that has accrued over time, including those with a security angle, now that the Foundation has a full-time engineer dedicated to crates.io.


## Community and Industry

Rust has been officially [added](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/rust-identified-as-safer-coding-tool-by-nist/) to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) list of [safer programming languages](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ssd/software-quality-group/safer-languages). While not an official endorsement from NIST, it does show that Rust can be considered suitable for safe and secure programming in government work and beyond. 

The Rust Foundation is a member of open source (OSS) core planning team (CPT) of the [Joint Cyber Defense Collaborative](https://www.cisa.gov/topics/partnerships-and-collaboration/joint-cyber-defense-collaborative)(JCDC), part of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA). Here the Foundation will collaborate with other members of government and industry to work to secure open source software in operational technologies, industrial control systems and beyond.

Shane Miller, former Rust Foundation Board Chair and now Foundation Distinguished Advisor, published a [blog post](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/rewarding-resilience-rust-the-u-s-national-cybersecurity-strategy/) on the U.S. National Cybersecurity strategy and how it might align with the Rust ecosystem.
