This month, the Rust Infrastructure threat model became [available](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Qlf8lk7VbpWhA0wHqJj4syYuUVr8rkGVM-k2qkb0QE/) and there has been some security-based action in the crates.io ecosystem.

## Threat Modeling

Here is the progress on the four threat models being developed by the Rust Foundation:

1. **Crates ecosystem**: [Published](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YxpJ0W5eqat2Y3ZfbdwKm_AoNhX3hIj_/).
2. **Rust Infrastructure**: [Published](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Qlf8lk7VbpWhA0wHqJj4syYuUVr8rkGVM-k2qkb0QE/)
3. **crates.io**: Potential threats identified. Filling out the details.
4. **Rust Project**: Threat outline developed.

## Engineering

The technical staff at the Rust Foundation continues to work on engineering efforts directly related to security:

### X-Forwarded-For Header Processing

Tobias [implemented](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/7359) [`ngx_http_realip_module`](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_realip_module.html) directly into the axum server, further reducing the need for custom `nginx` wrappers. Security-wise, Tobias also found that Heroku wasn't handling the `x-forwarded-for` headers correctly. Instead of adding the connecting IP to the last header, or merging the headers, it adds the IP to the first header. This was reported to Heroku and the hope is that they fix it, but, for now, the PR implements a workaround.

### crates.io Request Failure Incident

crates.io [experienced](https://status.crates.io/incidents/fsrmr4bk8trw) some failing requests and timeouts on October 18 due to an unexpected increase in traffic. While this looks to have been legitimate downloads requests spiking, Tobias is leading the investigation to ensure there is no major security issue.

### Replace Ring with p256

Tobias has [moved](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/7252) the crates.io dependency on `ring` over to `p256`. The `ring` project is releasing new versions without tags on the corresponding repository or even changelog entries, which is leaving us in the dark of what has changed or what is new. `p256` is a pure-Rust alternative for the only ring algorithm that we're currently using, and it also includes functions to parse the PEM format public keys.

### Reading Dependencies from Cargo.toml

To avoid the [hole](https://blog.vlt.sh/blog/the-massive-hole-in-the-npm-ecosystem) found in the `npm` ecosystem, Tobias is [proactively ensuring](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/7238) that all dependencies are read from an embedded `Cargo.toml` file as opposed to a JSON metadata blog.


### Typo-squatting Checks when new Packages are Published

Building the on the release of [Typomania](https://github.com/rustfoundation/typomania), Adam has now moved on to the next step by drafting a [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/7206) to wire it into the crates.io publishing pipeline to notify Security Initiative team members when a potential typo-squatting incident occurs in real time when new crates are published.

### Painter

A [Painter](https://github.com/rustfoundation/painter) technical blog post is being drafted for publication in November. 

Walter has added crate and function level data annotations, including for unsafe code. Also, Walter has implemented the parsing of 3rd party C-library dependencies in order to get visibility into potential vulnerabilities in libraries such as, for example, `libwebp`. If Walter is able to determine the version of the library, he can add the call graph, and see if any crates that import that C-library dependency are potentially vulnerable.

## Community

Walter and Joel attended an open source security round-table with members of the open source, language and package ecosystem community. Walter presented on [Painter](https://github.com/rustfoundation/painter) and we had folks wanting continuous access to its data - which we are working on setting up the infrastructure for that. Most of the presentations were on various mechanisms to secure package ecosystems, and there are ideas and implementations(e.g., machine-based identity, TUF, trusted publishers, etc.) that may make sense for the Rust Project.

Adam and Tobias attended [PackagingCon 2023](https://packaging-con.org/) to network with other package manager ecosystems and share ideas on securing them. Adam also gave a [presentation](https://cfp.packaging-con.org/2023/talk/RNYVN9/) called *What's in a name(space)?* that discusses how different package ecosystems, including Rust, handle naming.

Members of the Rust Foundation attended [EuroRust](https://eurorust.eu/2023/), which the Rust Foundation sponsored. 

New Rust Foundation Project Directors were [announced](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/10/19/announcing-the-new-rust-project-directors.html).

Tobias published a [post](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/10/26/broken-badges-and-23k-keywords.html) detailing what happened when a crate lost one of its badges because it was using 23K features within its crates.

The Crate Quarantine [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3464) has been revitalized with a review by Tobias this month.

The [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3463) proposed to update the Terms of Use for crates.io is in its [Final Comment Period (FCP)](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/09/22/crates-io-usage-policy-rfc.html). Discussion still continues. This RFC is based on prior work by other package managers such as PyPI and npm. The main motivation for this RFC is to give the crates.io team a fixed set of rules to determine if a project is using crates.io in a reasonable way, or if the user should get a warning and the project potentially be removed. It is mostly codifying the existing practices of the team, except for being more strict regarding name squatting.
