While travel and the Rust Global and RustConf conferences dominated about half of September for the Rust Foundation, there is still some excellent engineering updates to showcase.

The first of our four threat models is now publicly available. The [crates ecosystem threat model](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YxpJ0W5eqat2Y3ZfbdwKm_AoNhX3hIj_/) describes, in the context of who and how crates are published and deployed, the threats that can exist for crates packages. Some of these threats include malicious crate deployment, token theft and personnel reduction. Each threat scenario provides recommendations on how to mitigate that specific threat.

## Threat Modeling

Here is the progress on the four threat models being developed by the Rust Foundation:

1. **Crates ecosystem**: [Published](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YxpJ0W5eqat2Y3ZfbdwKm_AoNhX3hIj_/).
2. **Rust Infrastructure**: About to be circulated privately to the security-initiative working group
3. **crates.io**: Outline complete. First threat ranking in progress.
4. **Rust Project**: Potential outline developed.

## Engineering

The technical staff at the Rust Foundation continues to work on engineering efforts directly related to security:

### Crate signing

Crate signing is an important part of a holistic security strategy for the Rust ecosystem. There is now a public key infrastructure (PKI) [RFC draft](https://hackmd.io/Q2PQ1Y_4SoqwPfLcWbxLAQ). This draft will be soon be published as an official Rust Project RFC to be discussed by project members and the community. The hope is to pass this RFC as a first step towards using signing to help mitigate some of the [threats](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YxpJ0W5eqat2Y3ZfbdwKm_AoNhX3hIj_/) in the crates ecosystem.

### Painter

[Painter](https://github.com/rustfoundation/painter) is now over 110 stars on GitHub and has been updated with expanded coverage. There is support now for extract unsafe code statistics. Also, recent work has brought Painter's coverage of the crate ecosystem from 70% to 85%. The Foundation is planning a dedicated blog post on Painter and its technical details.


### TypoMania

The Foundation has another open source project. Building on [TypoGard](https://github.com/dangardner/typogard), originally by Matthew Taylor's team at the University of Kansas, and then adapted for crates.io by Dan Gardner at AWS; Adam Harvey, a software engineer at the Foundation, has released a Rust-based version of this project — [Typomania](https://github.com/rustfoundation/typomania) — that attempts to mitigate the practice of typo-squatting. While Rust the language is quite secure and the overall ecosystem is generally secure as well, crate package typo-squatting is one of the main threat vectors that exist. This tool tries to find and resolve any existing potentially malicious crates that may be trying to pretend to be another.

The next step in this project will be wiring Typomania into the crates.io publishing pipeline to notify Security Initiative team members when a potential typo-squatting incident occurs in real time. This is anticipated to happen in the next week.

### Publish Notification Emails

An [older pull request](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/2705) that would send an email notification to a crate publisher every time a new version of that crate is published has been [resurrected](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/318791-t-crates-io/topic/publish.20notification.20emails). In short, these emails would be sent to ensure that crate owners would know if someone other than themselves are trying to manipulate their crates. [Discussion](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/318791-t-crates-io/topic/publish.20notification.20emails) on how best to implement is still happening.

### Package Manifest Confusion

Over the last month, Tobias worked towards treating `Cargo.toml` manifest files as the source of truth for any package metadata (incl. dependencies) when uploaded to crates.io. This involved fixing the crates.io test suite to [generate manifests](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/7138) matching the usual metadata JSON blob. Related to that, Adam implemented a [PR](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/7008) that rejects crate packages that have multiple `Cargo.toml` manifests.

## Community

The Rust Foundation is [now](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/announcing-the-rust-foundation-s-associate-membership-with-openssf/) an associate member of the OSSF.

The [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3463) proposed to update the Terms of Use for crates.io is in its [Final Comment Period (FCP)](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/09/22/crates-io-usage-policy-rfc.html). This RFC is based on prior work by other package managers such as PyPI and npm. The main motivation for this RFC is to give the crates.io team a fixed set of rules to determine if a project is using crates.io in a reasonable way, or if the user should get a warning and the project potentially be removed. It is mostly codifying the existing practices of the team, except for being more strict regarding name squatting.

The Rust Foundation hosted its [first Rust Global event](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/rust-foundation-to-host-inaugural-rust-global-event-at-wasmcon-2023/) at WASMCon 2023 on 6 September 2023. It was standing room only with great presentations from Fastly, Microsoft and even the Rust Foundation, where a technical panel with Walter Pearce, Adam Harvey and Joel Marcey was held.

[RustConf](https://rustconf.com/) was held from 12-15 September in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Most of the Foundation staff attended, and included presentations from its infrastructure engineer, Jan David Nose, and community advocate (and planner of the event), Sage Griffin.

Jan David Nose, lead infrastructure engineer at the Rust Foundation, is [now](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2023/09/08/infra-team-leadership-change.html) a Rust Project [infrastructure team](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/infra) lead. Congratulations, JD!
