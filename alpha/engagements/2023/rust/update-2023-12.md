The highlight of this month is that two tools developed by the Foundation, [Typomania](https://github.com/rustfoundation/typomania) and Sandpit (not yet public) actively caught malicious crates within the crates.io ecosystem.

## Threat Modeling

Here is the progress on the four threat models being developed by the Rust Foundation:

1. **Crates ecosystem**: [Published](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YxpJ0W5eqat2Y3ZfbdwKm_AoNhX3hIj_/).
2. **Rust Infrastructure**: [Published](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10Qlf8lk7VbpWhA0wHqJj4syYuUVr8rkGVM-k2qkb0QE/)
3. **crates.io**: Potential threats continued to be detailed. Expect publication in the next couple of months.
4. **Rust Project**: Threat outline developed.

## Engineering

The technical staff at the Rust Foundation continues to work on engineering efforts directly related to security:

### Typomania

Adam [integrated](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/7206) [Typomania](https://github.com/rustfoundation/typomania) into the [crates.io](https://crates.io) publishing pipeline such that it is run whenever a crate is published to attempt to detect a potential malicious crate trying to use typo-squatting. This integration actually caught such a malicious crate! And it went through the Rust Project's [Security Response Working Group](https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/wgs/wg-security-response) [process](https://github.com/rust-lang/wg-security-response). Typomania is paying immediate dividends and has the potential to be used with other ecosystems as well. 

Also, Typomania has been adjusted, based on a recent campaign of malicious crates, to make it more sensitive to actual patterns weâ€™re seeing in the wild by adding support for checking if common suffixes have been added or removed from a crate name (e.g., `-rs`).

### Sandpit

Walter has developed a tool called Sandpit as part of the security initiative's Rust ecosystem scanning process. Sandpit scans available crates to try to detect malicious crates based on available heuristics. Sandpit also caught a potentially malicious crate. Sandpit is still under development and there are plans to make it public.

### Disabling Non-canonical Crate Downloads

Last month, Tobias [announced](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/10/27/crates-io-non-canonical-downloads.html) that support for non-canonical downloads on crates.io would be removed. A non-canonical download is the ability to download a crate if you, for example, replace a hyphen in a name with an underscore - crates.io would just normalize those to be the same. Removing support for non-canonical downloads from crates.io allows using CDNs directly for download requests because of required database lookups that were required for supporting this feature. Non-canonical downloads have now been [disabled](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/7549) and the supporting code will be removed next month.

### Using `async/await` in crates.io

The crates.io background worker code is being ported to using more [`async/await`](https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/01_getting_started/04_async_await_primer.html) in order to replace some older dependencies that are no longer unmaintained.


### Cargo Version Usage Visualization

Tobias and JD created a public [dashboard](https://p.datadoghq.com/sb/3a172e20-e9e1-11ed-80e3-da7ad0900002-973f4c1011257befa8598303217bfe3a?refresh_mode=sliding&from_ts=1700688567286&to_ts=1701293367286&live=true) with DataDog that shows how many crates.io download requests are received based on a given `cargo` version. This allows the visualization of how with every release, the amount of crate download requests continue to increase, showing that the crates ecosystem is becoming ever more popular and thus more ripe for potential malicious attacks. 


## Community

Microsoft has [announced](https://x.com/dwizzzleMSFT/status/1720134540822520268?s=20) a further $1M investment into the Rust Foundation.

The [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3463) proposed to [update](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/09/22/crates-io-usage-policy-rfc.html) the Terms of Use for crates.io has been approved, merged and landed. It has officially been integrated into the crates.io policy. This RFC is based on prior work by other package managers such as PyPI and npm. The main motivation for this RFC is to give the crates.io team a fixed set of rules to determine if a project is using crates.io in a reasonable way, or if the user should get a warning and the project potentially be removed. It is mostly codifying the existing practices of the team, except for being more strict regarding name squatting. Tobias is currently looking at 20 obvious spam accounts and will most likely remove those crates. For those that may be legitimate, emails will be sent with a grace period.
