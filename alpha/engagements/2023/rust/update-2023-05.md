## Engineering

The engineering staff at the Rust Foundation has begun software development work in earnest. There are five primary engineering efforts in the pipeline at the moment:

### crates.io admin console

An initial prototype of the [crates.io admin console](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/318791-t-crates-io/topic/crates.2Eio.20admin.20area.20plan) has been [developed](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/6353). The console is HTML-based and can currently list crate versions, search through crates and yank problematic crates.  

### Surfacing crates.io security information

As part of the Rust Foundation's [security initiative](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-13-rust-foundation-establishes-security-team/), we would like to [surface information related to crate security more prominently within crates.io](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/6397). The initial focus is on supply chain security, so surfacing information relevant to provenance is key, but we would also like to rapidly start surfacing information relevant to the security of individual crate versions as well.

A [draft plan](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/6397) has been developed and is currently in the commenting phase.

### crates.io token scope improvements

An [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/2947-crates-io-token-scopes.md) for implementing scopes for crates.io tokens has been [on the books](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2947) for nearly three years now, finally [accepted](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2947#issuecomment-1306954032) for engineering work at the end of 2022. The implementation of scoped tokens would allow users to restrict the actions a token can do, decreasing the risk in case of automation bugs or token compromise.

That engineering work is now [in progress](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/5443). The last month focused on adding endpoints for GET and PUT responses for various scopes.

### crates.io technical debt reduction

With two full time software engineers onboard dedicated to the security initiative, there is now an opportunity to reduce the amount of technical debt that has built up over the years.

From [fixing visualization charts](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/6204) to [adding more tracing information](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/6380), these fixes will allow for a more stable and efficient crates.io.

### Threat Model Engineering Preparation

As the security threat models are being completed and reviewed, engineering is spinning up to support work coming out of those threat models. While not ready for public release yet, development has begun on call graph support for the crates ecosystem and setting up the infrastructure to support sandboxed security work and testing for crates.


## Threat Modeling

Here is the progress on the four threat models being developed by the Rust Foundation:

1. **crates.io**: First draft in progress
2. **Crates ecosystem**: First draft developed and disseminated for limited, private review. Gathering feedback now.
3. **Rust Project**: First draft in progress
4. **Rust Infrastructure**: First draft in progress

## Community and Industry

The Foundation is being represented at the [Open Source Summit North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/open-source-summit-north-america/) from 9-12 May in Vancouver with direct participation in two sessions:

1. At [OpenSSF Day North America](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/openssf-day-north-america/program/schedule/), Walter Pearce will be on a [panel](https://openssfna2023.sched.com/event/1KriY/alpha-omega-securing-open-source-software-through-direct-maintainer-engagement-mikael-barbero-eclipse-foundation-walter-pearce-rust-foundation-ram-iyengar-cloud-foundry-foundation-munawar-hafiz-openrefactory-moderator-yesenia-yser-the-linux-f?iframe=no) titled "*Alpha-Omega: Securing Open Source Software Through Direct Maintainer Engagement*".
2. Rust Foundation Executive Director, Bec Rumbul, and Foundation Director of Marketing and Communications, Gracie Gregory, will be giving a [talk](https://ossna2023.sched.com/event/1K5Cx/developing-a-long-term-strategy-for-sustainability-rebecca-rumbul-gracie-gregory-rust-foundation?iframe=no&w=100%&sidebar=yes&bg=no) on "*Developing a Long Term Strategy for Sustainability*".

Also, our newest software engineer, Tobias, had his [welcome post](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/welcoming-software-engineer-tobias-bieniek-to-the-rust-foundation-team/) go live as well.
