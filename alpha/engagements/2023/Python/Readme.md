February was the month during which we accepted resumes for the Security Developer in Residence Role, see our post here. https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/01/the-psf-is-hiring-security-developer-in.html
Since the posting, we received over 50 applications, have conducted screens with 10 and are likely promoting 4 candidates to a longer interview and exercise.

We hope to get you updates from the person who will be carrying out the program work started soon.
We haven't offered anyone the role yet. We held our flagship event at the end of April and had to put interviews on hold for a bit as we had different hiring committee members travelling at all different times. 
The committee is meeting in a few minutes and we are hoping to make an offer soon.
