## Update 2022-08

The following update are according to the [Security Support Role](./security-support-role.md) document.

Each section points to at least one item to the priority list defined by Security Support Role document.

### 1) Fix security issues / 3) Incoming Triage (HackerOne)

In August, Rafael was responsible for the security triage* from 2022-08-07 until 2022-08-21

* Triagged HackerOne reports:
  * 1675191
  * 1675532
  * 1665156
  * 1667871
  * 1684830
  * 1667871

* Security Fixes:
  1) 1642017 (GHSA-8qr4-xgw6-wmr3) - [Undici v5.8.2](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/releases/tag/v5.8.2)
  2) 1638888 (GHSA-f772-66g8-q5h3) - [Undici v5.8.2](https://github.com/nodejs/undici/releases/tag/v5.8.2)
  3) 1667064 - Node.js [full-icu](https://github.com/nodejs/full-icu-npm)

* Fix ready to land:
  1) 1632921
  2) 1665156
  3) 1675191

* The Node.js Security contains a [Triage Team](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/blob/main/Security-Team.md#team-responsible-for-triaging-security-reports).

> The responsibility of Triage is to determine whether Node.js must take any action to mitigate the issue, and if so, to ensure that the action is taken.
Mitigation may take many forms, for example, a Node.js security release that includes a fix, documentation, an informational CVE or blog post.

_*These identification are the report id in the Node.js HackerOne platform. For security reasons, it can't be disclosed until getting a CVE._

### 2) Dependency analysis/tracking/updates/supply chain

`zlib` recently disclosed the CVE-2022-37434.
This vulnerability was also [found](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments/issues/50) by our [Node.js Dependency Vuln Assessment](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs-dependency-vuln-assessments).

This repository contains a daily workflow to scan Node.js dependencies and look for vulnerabilities.
Whenever a vulnerability is found, an issue is created and we assess it.

The assessment for the zlib vulnerability is available at [#824](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/824#issuecomment-1230251891).

### 4) Security Releases

We are organizing the next Node.js Security release, an assessment should be created in September.
Beyond the Security Release, Rafael will perform the next two Node.js regular releases (See: https://github.com/nodejs/Release/issues/737).

Rafael is also in the rotation to the next Node.js major release v19.x.

### 5) Interlocks/Reporting

- Monthly report was submitted.

### 6) Improving security processes

* Mention cherry-pick risks on Node.js Release. [#44408](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44408)

### 7) Node.js Security Working Group / Node.js Release Working Group

* August Meetings (Security WG)
  - https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/818
  - https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/822

* August Meetings (Release WG)
  - https://github.com/nodejs/Release/issues/774

* There are four significant initiatives running in the Security WG:
  - Threat Model for Node.js
  - Best Practices Document
  - Automatic check for dependencies' vulnerabilities in Node.js CI
  - Permission System

* A separate meeting was realized with interested participants with the purpose to discuss the Threat Model.
  * See: https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/799

### 8) Security features

* Permission System
  * We're assessing the best user expercience for this feature
    * It requires a lot of rework and researches.
    * Example: moving `policy` documentation to a broad scope: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44222
  * TODO List:
    - [x] Improve the `THROW_IF_INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSION` call
      - (Done - Implemented radix-tree structure)
    - [x] Handle `spawn` process
    - [x] Handle Worker Threads
    - [ ] Research the possibility to change the current Module Resolution Algorithm to interact with the Permission System
    - [ ] Create a resolve path in the C++ side
    - [ ] Handle `symlinks` edge-cases
      - e.g: app doesn’t have access to the `bar/` folder
      - app symlinks `foo/asdf`  to `bar/asdf`
      - and then edits `foo/asdf` which is actually `bar/asdf` without ever touching `bar/` from the Node.js app perspective
