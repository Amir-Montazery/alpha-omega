### 5) Interlocks/Reporting

- Monthly report was submitted.

### 6) Improving security processes

* The workflow of a Security Release has changed to include two steps in the pipeline:
  * Whenever a security report is fixed, the binary will be built (when applicable) and
    sent to the reporter to validate and avoid insufficient fixes
  * PR: https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44806

* During the Security Release process, some PR were created as a clarification to each step:
  * https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44691 - Mention where to push security commits
  * https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44764 - Mention `git node --backport`
  * https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44760 - Ensure to revert `node_version` changes

In the previous report, the Node.js Vuln Assessment Workflow was briefly mentioned:

> This repository contains a daily workflow to scan Node.js dependencies and look for vulnerabilities.
Whenever a vulnerability is found, an issue is created and we assess it.

However, there was no defined workflow to look at such issues. Therefore, it was added as new step in the
Node.js Security WG meeting. Reference: https://github.com/nodejs/create-node-meeting-artifacts/pull/117

### 7) Node.js Security Working Group

* September Meetings (Security WG)
  - https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/829
  - https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/833

* September Meetings (Release WG)
  - https://github.com/nodejs/Release/issues/782
  - https://github.com/nodejs/Release/pull/785 (Collab Summit)

Oct 1 & Oct 2 happend the Node.js Collab Summit. Rafael wrote a presentation to give an overview of the Security WG.
It showed all the current initiatives:
  - Node.js Vuln Assessment Workflow
  - Threat Model
  - Node.js Best Practices document
  - Permission System

And they discussed how those initiatives would help the Node.js platform.

> Better pictures were taken and should be published soon.

### 8) Security features

Due to the time consumption that a release takes. In September, just a small amount of time was spent on the _Permission System_.
However, two **important** pull requests were approved and merged:

1) https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44074 - src: make ReqWrap weak
2) https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44222 - doc: move policy docs to the permissions scope

Both Pull Requests are extreme important to the development of the Permission System.
