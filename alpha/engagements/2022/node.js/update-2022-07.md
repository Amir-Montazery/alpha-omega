### 6) Improving security processes

* During the process of the Security Release, some documents were created to improve the security processes:

  * [Clarify Release process](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43739)
  * Add Security Release specifics to the documentation: [#43835](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43695)/[#43835](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43835)
  * Update `changelog-maker` usage in the release process: [#43696](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/43696)

* The Threat Model is being discussed in the Security WG
  * The structure was defined and currently we are working to document assumptions from the Node.js runtime
  * Further info: [#799](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/799)

### 7) Node.js Security Working Group / Node.js Release Working Group

* July Meetings (Security WG)
  - https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/808
  - https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/813

* July Meetings (Release WG)
  - https://github.com/nodejs/Release/issues/758
  - https://github.com/nodejs/Release/issues/764

* There are three significant initiatives running in the Security WG:
  - Security Model/Threat Model for Node.js
  - Automatic check for dependencies' vulnerabilities in Node.js CI
  - Permission Model

* As part of the process, open issues were re-evaluated and some of them were closed as out-of-date/solved.
  * To avoid out-of-date issues, a stale bot was added to the project: [#814](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/pull/814)

* To improve the communication between the Security WG Team a channel was created in the OpenJS Foundation Slack.
  * Join: `#nodejs-security-wg`
  * See: [#812](https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/812)

### 8) Security features

* The Permission System got its first Pull Request ðŸŽ‰
  * This Pull Request includes the foundation of the Permission Model
  * _src,process: initial permission model implementation_ [#44004](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44004)
  * Note: A long round of review and discussions is expected
