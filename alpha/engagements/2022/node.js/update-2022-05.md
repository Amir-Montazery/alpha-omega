- Monthly report was submitted.

### 6) Improving security processes

* The Security Model is being discussed in the Security WG and we have defined the structure of the document and what we are trying to achieve with it.
  * Further info: https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/799

* The Permission Model document is in the early stages and we are waiting for a first MVP (Permission System) before designing the API correctly
  * Further info: https://github.com/nodejs/security-wg/issues/791

### 7) Node.js Security Working Group

* We reactivated the Security WG on Node.js and the attendance is increasing, which is pretty good.

* There are two significant initiatives running in the Security WG:
  - Security Model/Threat Model for Node.js
  - Permission Model

### 8) Security features

* We are moving forward with a MVP to the Permission System in Node.js. The implementation is in progress.
