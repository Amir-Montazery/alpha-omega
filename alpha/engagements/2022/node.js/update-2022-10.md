## Update 2022-10

The following update are according to the [Security Support Role](./security-support-role.md) document.

Each section points to at least one item to the priority list defined by Security Support Role document.

### 1) Fix security issues / 3) Incoming Triage (HackerOne)

The Node.js team triaged 4 HackerOne reports in October:
  1) 1719275 - Closed as N/A
  2) 1727223 - Closed as Informative
  3) 1723863 - Closed as Informative
  4) 1747642 - Triaged

A new discussion was raised on the TSC repository with the objective to clarify security expectations
on experimental features [#TSC/1299](https://github.com/nodejs/TSC/issues/1299).

_*These identification are the report id in the Node.js HackerOne platform. For security reasons, it can't be disclosed until getting a CVE._

### 2) Dependency analysis/tracking/updates/supply chain

The `zlib` vulnerability mentioned on [August update](./update-2022-08.md) will be addressed by [#44412](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44412).

### 2.1) OpenSSL updates

OpenSSL released a security update (Oct 11th) including OpenSSL 3.0.6.
However, a few hours after, the OpenSSL team announced that version contains a regression:

```
We have received a report of a significant regression in the latest
3.0.6 and 1.1.1r versions. The regression is not thought to have
security consequences. While the regression is further investigated we
have taken the decision to withdraw the 3.0.6 and 1.1.1r versions and
instead recommend that users remain on the previous 3.0.5 and 1.1.1q
versions for now.

We will issue a new plan for the release of 3.0.7 and 1.1.1s soon.
```

Therefore, all the update PRs created were closed:

- v14.x https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44969
- v16.x https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44971
- v18.x https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44978

And a OpenSSL assessment was created in the Node.js blog including as a summary:

> The vulnerability in the OpenSSL Security release of Oct 11 2022 does not affect any active Node.js release lines, as well
as the zlib vulnerability (CVE-2022-37434) patched on the zlib Security release of Oct 13 2022, does not affect Node.js.

PR: https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/4892

Then, Oct 25th the Node.js was informed the next OpenSSL Security Release will be made available on Tuesday 1st November.
Therefore, a new OpenSSL assessement was created: https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/4899.

Available on https://nodejs.org/en/blog/vulnerability/openssl-november-2022/.

### 4) Security Releases

The OpenSSL Security Release triggered a Security Release on Node.js. Therefore, during the last weeks of October
the Node.js team worked on the next security release (available on November 4th). The updates will be available to the
active release lines:
- Node.js v19
- Node.js v18
- Node.js v16
- Node.js v14

Further information: [#359](https://github.com/nodejs-private/node-private/issues/359)

#### 4.1) Regular Releases

October was a month full of releases on Node.js. It includes a new LTS version (v18) and a new major version (v19):

- Node.js v18.11.0
- Node.js v18.12.0 (LTS)
- Node.js v19.0.0 *New
  - OpenJS Foundation v19 announcement: https://openjsf.org/announcement/2022/10/18/node-js-19-is-now-available/
  - Node.js v19 announcement: https://nodejs.org/en/blog/announcements/v19-release-announce/
- Node.js v16.18.0
- Node.js v14.21.0

### 5) Interlocks/Reporting

- Monthly report was submitted.

### 6) Improving security processes

Throughout the v19 major release ([#44626](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/44626)) some adjustments on the
release process were made:

* Improve the workflow to test release binaries [#45004](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/45004)
* Mark Node.js 12 as End-of-Life [#45186](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/45186)
* Change `make lint` to `make lint-md` [#45197](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/45197)

Two initiatives from the Node.js Security WG were moved to the final stage (review)

* Node.js Security Best Practices [#4896](https://github.com/nodejs/nodejs.org/pull/4896)

This document intends to extend the current threat model and provide extensive guidelines on how to secure a Node.js
application. The target audience is Node.js users/developers.

* Node.js Threat Model [#45223](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/45223)

This document was created aiming to provide context on what will/will not be considered a vulnerability in Node.js,
targeting Security Researchers, as well as serve as a guide for application security operations in support of
development teams building on top of the Node.js platform.

Is expected that both initiatives have a directly impact on the Node.js security processes.
