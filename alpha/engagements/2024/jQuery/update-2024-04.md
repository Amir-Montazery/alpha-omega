## jQuery Testing Infrastructure

Work has been completed to migrate testing infrastructure on four jQuery projects. jQuery Core (both `main` and `3.x-stable` branches), [jQuery Migrate](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/pull/503), and [jQuery UI](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/2221) were completed previously. Similar work has now been completed for [jQuery Color](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-color/pull/135). This includes:

- Migrating the testing scripts from `grunt` to `npm` scripts.
- Migrating QUnit test suite from TestSwarm, and the old Jenkins server, to GitHub Actions.
- Migrating QUnit test suite from Karma to using [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/) for local testing, and from testswarm-browserstack to directly [BrowserStack's REST API](https://github.com/browserstack/api) for CI testing.
- Building a standalone test server using Express and mock middleware.

Now that this is complete, we are almost ready to decommission the jenkins.jquery.com, as well as the infrastructure for TestSwarm. We will wait a few weeks to test jQuery UI after its recent 1.13.3 release in case any issues are found.

## plugins.jquery.com

The jQuery plugins site archive has been deployed. This is a static site that contains the contents of the old plugins.jquery.com site. The site is available at [https://plugins.jquery.com/](https://plugins.jquery.com/).

## healthyweb.org

As part of the [Healthy Web Checkup campaign](https://openjsf.org/blog/healthy-web-checkup), the OpenJS Foundation has been [working with the jQuery team](https://blog.jquery.com/2024/04/17/upgrading-jquery-working-towards-a-healthy-web/) to encourage users to improve the security of their sites. Updating jQuery is a small part of that, but an old jQuery is often a sign of a site that hasn't been maintained.

A tool has been deployed to healthyweb.org that can check the version of jQuery on a site and provide guidance on how to update it. The tool is available at [https://healthyweb.org/](https://healthyweb.org/). Source at <https://github.com/jquery/jquery-detect>.

## gzip issue for some CDN files

The jQuery team received a report that some files on the new CDN (Fastly) were not being gzipped. We are still investigating, but for now have enabled a gzip override at the Fastly level, in addition to what nginx already does at the origin.
