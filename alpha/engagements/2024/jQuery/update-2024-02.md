## jQuery Core Testing Infrastructure

Work has been completed on the `main` branch of jQuery in an effort to migrate jQuery Core's testing infrastructure off of deprecated or largely unsupported services and libraries. This includes:

- Migrating the jQuery Core testing scripts from `grunt` to `npm` scripts.
- Migrating the jQuery Core test suite from TestSwarm, which depended on an old Jenkins server, to GitHub Actions.
- Migrating the jQuery Core test suite from Karma to using [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/) directly for local testing and [BrowserStack's REST API](https://github.com/browserstack/api) for local and CI testing on BrowserStack.
- Building a standalone test server using Express and mock middleware.

The `main` branch is [now using the new infrastructure](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/dfc693ea25fe85e5f29da23752b0c7c8d285fbf0), and the `3.x-stable` branch is expected to follow soon.

## Migrated email service to forwardemail.net

jQuery emails can now be managed by the jQuery Infrastructure team. All jquery.com and jquery.org email addresses have been migrated from Google Groups to forwardemail.net. DNS for MX records has been changed to forwardemail.net servers. GSuite has been retired.

Credentials for the forwardemail.net account are in the OpenJS 1Password vault. All aliases are now live. SPF and DMARC records have been set to prevent spam from impersonating our domains.

forwardemail.net kindly donated jQuery a premium account for 9 years!
