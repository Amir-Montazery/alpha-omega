## jQuery Core Testing Infrastructure

Work has been completed to migrate testing infrastructure on three jQuery projects, including jQuery Core (both `main` and `3.x-stable` branches), [jQuery Migrate](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-migrate/pull/503), and [jQuery UI](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/pull/2221). This includes:

- Migrating the jQuery Core testing scripts from `grunt` to `npm` scripts.
- Migrating the jQuery Core test suite from TestSwarm, which runs on an old Jenkins server, to GitHub Actions.
- Migrating the jQuery Core test suite from Karma to using [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/)  for local testing and [BrowserStack's REST API](https://github.com/browserstack/api) for local and CI testing on BrowserStack.
- Building a standalone test server using Express and mock middleware.
- Adding GitHub Actions workflows to update git files on our Filestash server for jQuery Core, jQuery Migrate, and jQuery UI.

Migration is still required on one more project: jQuery Color. Once that is complete, the team will be able to decommission the old jenkins server and database as well as the infrastructure for TestSwarm.
