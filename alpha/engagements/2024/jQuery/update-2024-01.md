# Update 2024-01

## plugins.jquery.com

- Completed static archive of plugins.jquery.com, available at https://github.com/timmywil/plugins.jquery.com (the repo will be moved to the jQuery org after review).
- Preview is currently available at https://timmywil.com/plugins.jquery.com/ 
- Will move the plugins repo to the jQuery org when reviewed
- Like the trac sites, static search indexing is done using pagefind.js
- Removed all third-party requests, including removal of fontawesome icons and typekit font; replaced with inline SVG icons and self-hosted Cairo instead of Klavika.
- Added notice that the versions on the plugin registry are old and should not be used, pointing to npm instead.
- Once the site is deployed, the instance and database for plugins.jquery.com can then be shut down, thus removing their long-term security risk and continued maintenance/operational needs.

## jQuery Core Testing Infrastructure

Significant work has been completed in an effort to migrate jQuery Core's testing infrastructure off of deprecated or largely unsupported services and libraries. This includes:

- Migrating the jQuery Core testing scripts from `grunt` to `npm` scripts.
- Migrating the jQuery Core test suite from TestSwarm, which runs on an old Jenkins server, to GitHub Actions.
- Migrating the jQuery Core test suite from Karma to using [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/webdriver/) directly for local testing and [BrowserStack's REST API](https://github.com/browserstack/api) for local and CI testing on BrowserStack.
- Building a standalone test server using Express and mock middleware.

## CSP improvements on jQuery websites

- Third-party requests have been reduced on all jQuery content websites, beginning with the removal of the Adobe Typekit service, and replacing Klavika with a self-hosted copy of the open-licensed Cairo font. See also https://github.com/jquery/jquery-wp-content/issues/446.
