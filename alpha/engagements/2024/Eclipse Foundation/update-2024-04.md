# Eclipse Foundation Update â€” April 2024

## Management of GitHub Organizations and Repositories

The number of Eclipse Foundation projects incorporating OtterDog has reached 99, marking an increase of 5 since the end of March. OtterDog now manages the configuration of 1,217 repositories.

Eclipse OtterDog version 0.6.0 has been released. This month's updates include:
* Overhaul dasboard view  by showing various statistics over all configured projects, e.g., secret scanning activation or default branch protection enablement (https://github.com/eclipse-csi/otterdog/pull/223)
* Added support for OAuth authentication using GitHub. This form the basis for more administrator only information and actions on the dashboard (https://github.com/eclipse-csi/otterdog/issues/202)
* Use scoped commands for interaction via pull requests. (https://github.com/eclipse-csi/otterdog/issues/211)

Also, we started to use OtterDog to start enforcing low noise security features like secret scanning. We now have the assurnace that secret scanning is enabled in all repositories in OtterDog managed GitHub organization.

Finally, we got a logo done for the Eclipse Commin Security Infrastrusture (Eclipse CSI) to start to get a brand identity about the work we do. All CSI artworks are available in https://github.com/eclipse-csi/.github/tree/main/artwork/eclipse-csi.

## Vulnerability Management

With the succesfful deployment of Sonatype Lifecylce from last month, we have been able to tests different scenarios for continusouly monitoring past releases of Eclipse Glassfish (~50 artifacts) using the binary analysis feature of Sonatype Lifecycle and how to automate ingestion by using the API. The build integration and source-based analysis testing are planned for next month.

We also have released 2 CVEs for Eclipse Projects:
* [CVE-2024-0740](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-0740)
* [CVE-2024-3046](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-3046)

## Presentations and outreach

* We presented a talk titled "[Effective Vulnerability Management for Over 400 Projects at the Eclipse Foundation](https://sosscdna24.sched.com/event/1aNM7)" on April 15 at the SOSS Community Day North America.
* We released a report titled "[Pioneering Software Supply Chain Security with Eclipse Temurin](https://outreach.eclipse.foundation/adoptium-temurin-supply-chain-security)," demonstrating how the Eclipse Foundation and the Adoptium Working Group are working to build the world's most secure OpenJDK distribution.
* We participated in the Alpha-Omega roundtable on April 17 at the Open Source Summit North America.
* We presented a talk titled *Pioneering Strategies for Open Source Security* at the Ericsson Developer Conference (EDC) 2024 on April 17.
* We initiated discussions with Stacklok about how [Stacklok Minder](https://stacklok.com/minder) and [Eclipse OtterDog](https://github.com/eclipse-csi/otterdog) could align.

## Public policy

We announced our [Open Regulatory Compliance Working Group](https://outreach.eclipse.foundation/open-regulatory-compliance) initiative. The goal is to provide a vendor-neutral space for collaborating on the establishment of common specifications for secure software development based on existing open source best practices. The *Apache Software Foundation*, *Blender Foundation*, *OpenSSL Software Foundation*, *PHP Foundation*, *Python Software Foundation*, and *Rust Foundation* joined us in this announcement.

## Eclipse Foundation Staff and Infrastructure 

We are still looking for a new hire for the team. We had an excellent candidate who, unfortunately, rejected our offer at the last minute. As a result, we are back to square one for this position. We will revamp the job description to attract more qualified candidates.

Additionally, we have subscribed to a staff security awareness training platform to continue fostering a security culture within the Foundation's staff. We will roll out mandatory training first within the IT team, followed by the general staff over the summer.
