# Alpha-Omega Engagement: Rust Foundation 

First, thank you to Alpha-Omega for supporting the [Rust Foundation](https://rustfoundation.org).

The purpose of the Rust Foundation’s engagement with Alpha-Omega engagement is to provide security resources to the Rust Project and ecosystem via the Foundation’s [security initiative](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-13-rust-foundation-establishes-security-team/).

In addition to the monthly reports here in GitHub, the Rust Foundation provides regular reports of its progress and plans on its security initiative:
