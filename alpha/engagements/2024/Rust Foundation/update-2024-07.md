There has been continued progress on verifying the repos that crates say they are associated with. We are also nearly complete on moving our security to the cloud in order to have more consistent runs, analysis and data.

## Engineering

### Crate repo verification progress

Adam has continued working on [provenance](https://lawngno.me/blog/2024/06/10/divine-provenance.html) tracking, verifying that a given crate is actually associated with the repository it claims to be. He has now analyzed the top 5000 crates by download count and has found no obvious red flags. Verification now infers commits based on tag data if the crate file was packaged without VCS info. This finds more mismatches as a result, but they’re all innocent — build artifacts, swap files, etc. Up next is to analyze the entire crates.io corpus.

### Crate deletion RFC

The crate deletion [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3660) is close to moving into FCP now. Recall, Tobias wrote this RFC to provide crate owners with a mechanism to delete crates from crates.io under certain [conditions](https://github.com/Turbo87/rust-rfcs/blob/crates-io/crate-deletions/text/3660-crates-io-crate-deletions.md#proposal).

### crates.io lib/bin detection

Tobias backfilled `lib/bin` information for existing crate releases. The `has_lib` and `bin_names` columns in the crates.io database have been backfilled (see [conversation](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/318791-t-crates-io/topic/lib.2Fbin.20detection)). For example, https://crates.io/crates/ripgrep finally shows `cargo install` now.

### Crate specific RSS feed

Thanks to Tobias, there are now [crate-specific RSS feeds](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/9064). You can subscribe to get all the details on the specific crates you are interested in. RSS feeds per crate are published at https://static.crates.io/rss/crates/{name}.xml. The feeds are synced with the database in a background job after every successful publish of the corresponding crate. It includes the latest 10 releases of the crate, but at least all releases within the last 24 hours.

### Signing RFC Update

Walter, along with other Rust Project members, are nearly complete in drafting the wording to convert the existing [Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3579) to use TUF, which should alleviate many of the commented concerns.

## Announcements and Community

### New Infrastructure Engineer on Staff

We are pleased to [announce](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/welcoming-infrastructure-engineer-marco-ieni-to-the-rust-foundation-team/) that Marco Ieni has joined the Rust Foundation as the newest member of our engineering team! Marco joins the Rust Foundation as its second Infrastructure Engineer, providing much-needed support to the Rust project and its infrastructure. As a member of the engineering team, Marco will ensure that the infrastructure supporting Rust and related projects is reliable, efficient, productive, and secure. He will be responsible for the operations of all current and future infrastructure, managing existing tools and new developments while working directly with the Rust Project Infrastructure team in their daily activities.

### Sustainability Efforts

Adam continues to focus on project sustainability, focusing on repo and maintainer information. Adam gave a Python specific version of his [Quantifying Nebraska talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QMHpy_mcx0Q) at [North Bay Python](https://pretalx.northbaypython.org/nbpy-2024/talk/9EXJ7T/). He is developing tooling around this.

### Development of crates.io update

Tobias [published](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2024/07/29/crates-io-development-update.html) an update of the development progress of crates.io.

### RustConf in September

[RustConf](https://rustconf.com/) is approaching. 10-13 September in Montreal. There is still time to register.
