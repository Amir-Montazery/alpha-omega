# Rustls
Our goal is to build a safer TLS library that can largely replace OpenSSL over time. The headline features of the new library, Rustls, are performance and memory safety.

We are making great progress. The community is also growing rapidly, with new contributors showing up regularly and largely representing new consumers of Rustls.

  - This month's efforts were focused on landing the first version of an [OpenSSL compatibility layer for NGINX.](https://github.com/rustls/rustls-openssl-compat/releases) This will make it possible for NGINX users to switch from OpenSSL to Rustls within a few minutes, without needing to recompile. This was an important effort for Rustls because it creates a path to adoption that involves less effort. 




#Rust for Linux
  
Our goal is to make Rust a supported second language for Linux kernel development, and to foster the creation of drivers and modules written in Rust.

The primary maintainer of Rust for Linux, Miguel Ojeda, has been working full time under contract with Prossimo since April of 2021.

  - A ["fixes PR"](https://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20240427171549.934651-1-ojeda@kernel.org/)
was sent to Linus and merged for the incoming 6.9 release in May, with
most of the patches getting backported into stable kernel releases
too. Work is ongoing to prepare for 6.10 merge window.

  - The [Rust Microconference](https://lpc.events/event/18/contributions/1662/)
has been accepted for [Linux Plumbers Conference
2024](https://lpc.events). This will be the third year in a row the
Rust MC takes place in LPC. As usual, it is intended to cover both
Rust for Linux and other Rust topics.

  - The Nova project from Red Hat has now a [dedicated
page](https://rust-for-linux.com/nova-gpu-driver) in the Rust for
Linux website, maintained by the project's authors, like for the rest
of similar subpages.

  - Ready-to-be-used toolchains will be soon published at kernel.org
to help developers build Rust-enabled kernels with matching LLVM
versions, thanks to the ClangBuiltLinux project, which already [builds
optimized LLVM toolchains](https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/tools/llvm/).
The included Rust binaries are, for the moment, the usual official
Rust-provided ones.
