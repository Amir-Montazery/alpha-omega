  * Reduce the effort required for both security and non-security releases.

## 6) Ecosystem Adoption
  * Assist the community with security-related issues.
  * Provide security patches for high-impact libraries, such as undici and fastify.
  * Develop libraries that may be adopted by the community (e.g. is-my-node-vulnerable).
