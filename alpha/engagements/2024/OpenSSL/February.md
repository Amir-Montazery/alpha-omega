In Mid-February we received an update that 1 of the last 2 issue fixes (out of the 15 total issues) was done and will merge imminently. The remaining issue required more time, especially due to reduced availability of the team due to a face-2-face meeting. At this point we are fairly confident that the remaining fix, the fix review, and publication coordination will be completed by the end of March.
