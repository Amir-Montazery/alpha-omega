May was utilized mostly by supporting the OpenSSL team in preparation for publishing. This included adding a new fuzzer that can instantiate various types of cryptographic objects like ciphers, hashes, and KDFs, etc. For reference: https://github.com/openssl/openssl/pull/22964

A standard OSTIF process includes providing/implementing all of the security testing tools and infrastructure developed during the security audit for free to the project to use indefinitely. This requires close collaboration with project maintainers, which can take time. Since our primary goal is providing value and support to the open source projects and their communities, we strive to accomodate to their needs and timelines, even if it means taking a little longer than anticipated. 

Now that the fix review is complete, all updates have been made, and all parties are satisfied with the results, publication can be set! Results will be published imminently.
