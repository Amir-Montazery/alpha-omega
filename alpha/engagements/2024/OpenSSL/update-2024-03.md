March was utilized in fixing the remaining issue from the audit findings, and we can attest that it has been fixed and merged. We have a fix review scheduled for April 11th, in which the audit team reviews and verifies the fixes. Shortly after the fix review, we will coordinate and schedule publishing of the audit report! Thank you for your patience on this; we've found that working with and accomadating for the project community and development lifecycles tends to yield better results compared to a rushed effort. We are also happy to collaborate with OpenSSF/Project Alpha on publication and blog posts.
