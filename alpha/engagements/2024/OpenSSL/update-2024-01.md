January 2024 was utilized namely in the fixing and remediation of issues found in the security audit. 12 of the 15 issues have been fixed and remediated, with PRs to support. The remaining issues are being remediated, with one in particular requiring a significant amount of re-work and testing. 

We hope to close out the security audit in February or early March. The remaining issues need to be remediated, as well as a fix review by the audit team (something OSTIF includes with all security reviews) to confirm and verify the fixes, and coordinated publication.
