# Update 2024-03

Note that this month was on the quiet side due to
attending the CISA Open Source Security summit, having to take sick time off,
and taking a 2 week-long vacation.

## Conferences, Events, and Blogs

I attended the [Open Source Security summit](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/news/cisa-announces-new-efforts-help-secure-open-source-ecosystem) hosted by CISA in early March.
The event was attended by many other open source ecosystems. The summit focused on
strengthening the security of open source infrastructure like package repositories.

I'm [speaking](https://sched.co/1aNLj) at the [OpenSSF SOSS Community Day](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/soss-community-day-north-america/program/schedule/) in Seattle on April 15th. I'm also a participant in
the [Tabletop Exercise](https://sched.co/1aN8l) that caps off SOSS Community Day. Will attend the OSS Summit event as well.

Submitted an idea to Google Summer of Code 2024 with **Dustin Ingram** on adopting
the [OpenSSF Hardened Compiler Options for C/C++](https://best.openssf.org/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C++) for CPython.

Published a [report to my blog](https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-32) for the month of March.
