## Highlight: CPython Software Bill-of-Materials documents now available

[CPython 3.12.2](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3122/) is the first release to have SBOMs for source artifacts!

* [Published announcement on the PSF blog](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2024/02/software-bill-of-materials-now-available-for-cpython.html)
* Adding support for SBOMs for Windows artifacts is complete and awaiting reviews from Windows release managers, [pull requests](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/115789) [are completed](https://github.com/python/release-tools/pull/100).
* Support for macOS artifact SBOMs and Vulnerability Exchange is next after Windows SBOMs are done.
* Published [user documentation](https://python.org/download/sbom) for CPython SBOM documents.
* Worked closely with release managers, pip maintainers, and downstream distributors of CPython (mostly Fedora)
  to create a sustainable workflow.
* [Presented on the status and challenges](https://github.com/python/release-tools/pull/96) to the OpenSSF SBOM Everywhere SIG.
