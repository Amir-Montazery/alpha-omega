# Update 2024-05

The highlight of this month for any Pythonista is [PyCon US 2024](https://us.pycon.org/2024), the largest community gathering of Python developers
in the world. Security Developer-in-Residence Seth Larson [attended PyCon US](https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-36)
and delivered a talk on "[State of Python Supply Chain Security](https://us.pycon.org/2024/schedule/presentation/148/)" with Michael Winser to a packed
conference room and appeared on the main conference stage for the "Meet the Python Software Foundation Security Engineers" segment alongside PyPI Safety Engineer Mike Fiedler.

Seth's plans for the year ahead include collaborating with Python open source project maintainers, mainly adoption of security best practices, software bill-of-materials, and build provenance
across the Python packaging ecosystem.
Seth met with maintainers of large Python project communities like [Python Packaging Authority](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/) (PyPA), [Jazzband](https://jazzband.co/),
[Pallets](https://palletsprojects.com/), [Conda Forge](https://conda-forge.org/), and [scientific computing](https://github.com/scientific-python)
to discuss the year ahead.

Seth attended the [Python Language Summit](https://us.pycon.org/2024/events/language-summit/) to discuss CPython's security model for contributors
and co-hosted an [open space on Vulnerability Management](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7198439073034743809/) with GitHub Security and CVE board member Madison Oliver.

Shortly after PyCon US had wrapped it was announced that Seth Larson would be [keynoting PyCon Taiwan 2024](https://x.com/PyConTW/status/1793884640379335026) in September to talk about Software Supply Chain Security.

## Google Summer of Code mentor

Google Summer of Code 2024 recently published its program and among the projects and contributors
accepted was CPython's project for adopting the [Hardened Compiler Options Guide for C/C++](https://github.com/ossf/wg-best-practices-os-developers/blob/main/docs/Compiler-Hardening-Guides/Compiler-Options-Hardening-Guide-for-C-and-C%2B%2B.md).
Seth is mentoring the contributor through the process of contributing to CPython and hopefully being
successful in [adopting the OpenSSF hardened compiler options guide](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/112301).
