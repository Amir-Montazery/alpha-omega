# Update 2024-01

## Highlight: CPython Software Bill-of-Materials

The current status having CPython SBOM artifacts with releases is:

* Created a [draft SBOM document](https://gist.github.com/sethmlarson/103891c6cac4d41b11daab89e6c84868) from existing implementation
  and shared with OpenSSF Security Tooling and SBOM Everywhere working groups
  * Received feedback from Adolfo Garcia Veytia and Ritesh Noronha.
  * Meets NTIA Minimum Elements of an SBOM, achieved 9.6 / 10 on [SBOM Benchmark](https://sbombenchmark.dev/)
* python.org is [ready to accept SPDX SBOM files](https://github.com/python/pythondotorg/pull/2359) alongside release artifacts.
  These will be offered alongside other release artifacts. User-facing documentation for python.org
  is in-progress.
* Ready for CPython 3.13.0 (stable release in October 2024), backporting to the 3.12 release stream
  to be available earlier. 3.11 and earlier would take much more effort to implement.
* [Documentation for maintaining the SBOM documents](https://devguide.python.org/developer-workflow/sbom/) has been written for CPython core developers.

The first CPython release containing any SBOM information (3.13.0a3) also received feedback from downstream
distributors, mainly Fedora. Issues that were found during their repackaging of CPython were addressed.

Remaining work includes getting a release manager to approve the [SBOM generation during CPython releases](https://github.com/python/release-tools/pull/82)
and generating SBOMs for "built" artifacts for Windows and macOS.

## Reviewer for PEP 740 (digital attestations for PyPI artifacts)

This [proposal](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-740-index-support-for-digital-attestations/44498) was authored by William Woodruff, but I was a reviewer in the
[pre-PEP discussion](https://discuss.python.org/t/pre-pep-exposing-trusted-publisher-provenance-on-pypi/42337) and during the [initial PEP review](https://github.com/python/peps/pull/3618).
This work provides a standard mechanism for PyPI to host digital attestations (such as publish provenance) for artifacts.
This mechanism will be of interest for future work that I'm interested in tackling like build provenance of Python packages.

## Diffoscope support for XAR/PKG format

CPython publishes PKG files for the macOS platform which use the XAR archive format.
The [diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org) tool was indispensable for making CPython's source
artifacts reproducible, but didn't have support for XAR/PKG files. As a part of having reproducible
builds of macOS I [contributed support](https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/diffoscope/-/merge_requests/134) for the XAR/PKG format upstream.

XAR/PKG support was [released in version 254 of diffoscope](https://diffoscope.org/news/diffoscope-254-released/).
