## Attestations
Link to attestations: https://github.com/OpenRefactory-Inc/attestations

### Cumulative Data 
| Month                               | Mar 2024 |
|-------------------------------------|----------|
| Total # of Unique Projects          | 16       |
| Total # of Unique Releases/Versions | 75       |
| Total # of Generated Attestations   | 75       |

### Example
Below is an example of the attestation JSON that we are generating. Here, as the `subject` field, we are using the archive (ZIP) of each release's source code. As for the `predicate` field, we're using the [Cosign Vuln. Attestation Spec](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/main/specs/COSIGN_VULN_ATTESTATION_SPEC.md). Right now, inside the `predicate.scanner.result` field, we're storing two fields- `bugs` and `summary`. The `bugs` field contains the list of bugs found in that specific version of the project, and the `summary` field contains messages and total number of bugs.

We're using Cosign/Sigstore to sign and verify the attestation. As for the final format/schema of the attestaion, we're open to suggestions.
