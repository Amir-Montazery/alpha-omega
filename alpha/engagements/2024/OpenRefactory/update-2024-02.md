##CVE Initiated
A couple of projects fixed the bugs that we reported and is in the process of creating CVEs.

In project MSS maintained by Open-MSS, we reported a path manipulation issue as a security advisory. The bug has been fixed and has been identified as critical. The project is undergoing the steps to request a CVE. More details here: https://github.com/Open-MSS/MSS/security/advisories/GHSA-pf2h-qjcr-qvq2

In project ckan we reported a log injection by emailing to a specific email address used for security issues. This has been accepted. The project is undergoing the steps to request a CVE.

##Attestation Workflows
We created two workflows that show how the attestations are to be generated and stored in a GitHub repository and how the the attestations are to be verified.

Workflow 1 shows the generation process.

Workflow 2 shows the verification process.

We will share some video snippets of the steps in the next month.
