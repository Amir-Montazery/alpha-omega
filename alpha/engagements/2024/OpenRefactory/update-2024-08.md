#### Two High Severity Bugs
- Log Injkection
    (Python) python-microscopy/python-microscopy @ 3e6e5f24b0920f892bb1b4745cfb86b34f88e66a :: https://groups.google.com/u/1/a/openrefactory.com/g/vulnerability-reporting/c/-1gn17xd7ic  (Private email to maintaier)    
    (Previously, we mistook two bugs for project python-microscopy as one - due to script's logical error. This month it has been added)

- Weak Crypto
    (Python) ckan/ckan @ 2.9.9 :: https://github.com/ckan/ckan/pull/7768
    (This bug was mis-categorized under a different category. This month, we've categorized it under the correct one)

### Note
[1] This month, we cleaned our Google sheets. We found some duplicates in our data, we removed them. We found some bugs whose status weren't updated. Also, we find a few bugs that were mislabelled. From this month, we are collaging all of our data into a single sheet- for ease of access and report generation.
