## Change of Plan From February

From February, we will be mostly concentrating on bugs in Python applications. We have created a list of the top 10,000 Python projects in the PyPI repository based on the number of downloads over the last one year period. We will concentrate on the last five release branches of each of the projects. That gives us about 50,000 target projects. The results will be updated to the Google sheet file as usual. At the same time, we are exploring options to generate attestations regarding the scan and the findings. More details will be available in the February report. 
 

## Reduction in the number of bugs filed

The total number of bugs filed rediced in January is lower than the bugs filed before. This is because we have stopped reporting logical bugs and low severity security bugs. This change in scope happened after getting feedback from the Alpha-Omega stakeholders.
