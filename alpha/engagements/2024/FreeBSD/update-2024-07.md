FreeBSD is undertaking one main project -- a code audit of two significant
subsystems (the bhyve hypervisor, and the Capsicum sandboxing framework) -- and
two minor ones (an MFA pilot and an initial process audit).

## Update summary

The code audits are progressing to plan and producing useful insights into
areas for improvement. Both the bhyve and Capsicum code audit are complete.


## Code Audit

The code audit is intended to discover vulnerabilities in these systems to
redress, but will also look to identify classes of vulnerabilities and/or
suboptimal coding practices that we can look for across the project and
incorporate learnings from into our Committer training and onboarding.

The FreeBSD Foundation has appointed a code audit firm, Synacktiv, who conducted the code audit on its behalf.

### bhyve Hypervisor

#### Audit information

Audit start date: 	2024-06-01  
Audit end date: 	2024-06-24  
Code version:		Branch = FreeBSD main (development) branch on 2024-06-05,  
                    Commit = `56b822a17cde5940909633c50623d463191a7852`

The code audit is finished. A significant number of vulnerabilities have been
found across a number of attack surfaces, some of which might result in VM
escape. Some patterns in the code security gaps are already observable and will
be addressed as classes of vulnerabilities in our updated committer training
and onboarding.

### Capsicum Sandboxing Framework

#### Audit information

Audit start date: 	2024-07-01  
Audit end date: 	2024-07-31  
Code version:		Branch = FreeBSD main (development) branch on 2024-06-05,  
                    Commit = `56b822a17cde5940909633c50623d463191a7852`

The code audit is finished. A moderate number of vulnerabilities were discovered, however, the code base is much larger than for bhyve and so the audit was not as comprehensive. Some patterns in the code security gaps are already observable and will be addressed as classes of vulnerabilities in our updated committer training
and onboarding.

## Process Audit

The process audit is in the planning phase and will commence in August.


## MFA Pilot

The MFA pilot is in the planning phase and will commence in September.
