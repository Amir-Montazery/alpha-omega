# FreeBSD Update - July 2024

## Program Overview
FreeBSD is undertaking one main project and two minor ones:

Major: A code audit of two significant subsystems (the bhyve hypervisor, and the Capsicum sandboxing framework)

Minor: An MFA pilot and an Initial Process Audit

## Update summary
The code audit is complete and the FreeBSD Project is now addressing newly-discovered vulnerabilities. The FreeBSD Foundation will release the full code-audit report when directed by the FreeBSD Project Security Team. The FreeBSD Foundation will work with the FreeBSD Project to identify classes of vulnerabilities where possible, and to create documentation, training, or education, and update processes and policies as needed to reduce current and future vulnerabilities.



## Code Audit

### About the code audit
The code audit is intended to discover vulnerabilities in these systems to
redress, but also looked to identify classes of vulnerabilities and/or
suboptimal coding practices that we can look for across the project and
incorporate learnings from into our Committer training and onboarding.

The FreeBSD Foundation appointed a code audit firm, Synacktiv, who conducted the code audit on its behalf.

### July update
The code audit firm, Synacktiv, has completed the code audit of bhyve and Capsicum on time. They have provided us with a report that contains useful insights into
areas for improvement. The FreeBSD Project will address newly-discovered vulnerabilities according to its existing [Security Processes](https://www.freebsd.org/security/) and [vulnerability reporting procedure](https://www.freebsd.org/security/reporting/).

#### bhyve Hypervisor - Audit information

Audit start date: 	2024-06-01  
Audit end date: 	2024-06-24  
Code version:		Branch = FreeBSD main (development) branch on 2024-06-05,  
                    Commit = `56b822a17cde5940909633c50623d463191a7852`

The code audit is finished. A significant number of vulnerabilities have been
found across a number of attack surfaces, some of which might result in VM
escape. Some patterns in the code security gaps are already observable and will
be addressed as classes of vulnerabilities in our updated committer training
and onboarding.

#### Capsicum Sandboxing Framework - Audit information

Audit start date: 	2024-07-01  
Audit end date: 	2024-07-31  
Code version:		Branch = FreeBSD main (development) branch on 2024-06-05,  
                    Commit = `56b822a17cde5940909633c50623d463191a7852`

The code audit is finished. A small number of vulnerabilities were discovered, however, the code base is much larger than for bhyve and so the audit was not as comprehensive. The FreeBSD Project will address these vulnerabilities and will make changes to development practices as needed to reduce incidence of similar future vulnerabilities. 

## Process Audit

The process audit is in the planning phase and will commence in October. 


## MFA Pilot

The MFA pilot is in the planning phase and will commence in September.
