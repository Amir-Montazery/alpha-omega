# Build provenance for Homebrew: February 2024

## Completed

* We attended the 2024 Homebrew AGM and presented the current status of our
  work, as well as future plans, to the Homebrew member body.

* We merged v3 bundle verification support in `sigstore-python`:
  <https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/901>

* We have produced an MVP implementation of `brew verify` for attestation
  verification, and have temporarily homed in under
  <https://github.com/trailofbits/homebrew-brew-verify> pending further review
  and upstreaming into `Homebrew/brew`.

* We completed our initial API changes to `betterptoto`:
  <https://github.com/danielgtaylor/python-betterproto/pull/551>

## In progress

* We are making further upstream improvements and fixes to `betterproto`, as part
  of unblocking support for `betterproto` in `in_toto_attestations`:
  <https://github.com/danielgtaylor/python-betterproto/pull/559>

* We are continuing our work on DSSE support in `sigstore-python`, working
  on DSSE verification after last month's DSSE signature generation work:
  <https://github.com/sigstore/sigstore-python/pull/904>

* We are continuing our work on "backfill" attestations for `homebrew-core`,
  beginning with a survey of pre-existing unattested bottles and scheduling
  mechanisms for signing them in batches. Our progress is here:
  <https://github.com/trailofbits/homebrew-brew-verify/tree/backfill>
