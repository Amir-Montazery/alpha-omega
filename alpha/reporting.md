# Reporting Expectations for Alpha Engagements

This document describes reporting expectations for Alpha engagements -- meaning, those organizations
or projects that receive funds or other support from OpenSSF through Alpha-Omega.

The goal is to provide transparency to our stakeholders (including the public) around the improvements
made over time. It isn't intended to be a full accounting of all activity that occurred -- just the
highlights.

### Format

The format is up to each organization. We like the format that the Node.js team has been using 
([example](engagements/2022/node.js/update-2022-07.md)), but don't feel obligated to follow that
template. We'd prefer updates in Markdown, but any of the markup [formats](https://github.com/github/markup#markups)
supported by GitHub are acceptable. (This is important because we want the content to be discoverable,
and uploading PDFs hinder that.)

Please include enough detail to give a reader a sense of what was done and why it was important. Don't
just include a single link out to another location, but you can of course link to additional material
and details.

### Timeline

Please provide updates monthly, around the first of each month.

### Process

To submit an update, just send a pull request into this repository, with a new file added in
the relevant directory:

```
/alpha/engagements/<year>/<organization>/<file.md>
```

A good choice of filename is `update-2022-06.md` (for the June 2022 update).

Submit the pull request, and we'll merge it in.

### Questions?

If there's anything here that isn't clear, please open an issue in this repo or reach out to us on
the OpenSSF #alpha_omega Slack channel.
